Twenty Years’ Experience<br />
as a Ghost Hunter
</p>


<h2 class="nb">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subt">I COMMENCE MY GHOSTLY INVESTIGATIONS IN DUBLIN</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> starting a book of this sort, I believe it is usual to
say something about one’s self.</p>

<p>I was born in the ’seventies. My father came from
County Limerick, and belonged to the Truagh Castle
O’Donnells, who, tracing their descent from Shane
Luirg, the elder brother of Niall Garbh, the ancestor
of Red Hugh, rightly claim to be the oldest branch of
the great clan. He graduated at Trinity College,
Dublin, was for some time vicar of a parish near
Worcester, and died in Egypt, under mysterious and
much discussed circumstances,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> soon after I came into
the world.</p>

<p>My mother was English; she belonged to an old
Midland family, and only survived my father a few
years.</p>

<p>Although I am generally known as a ghost hunter,
needless to say it was not for such a career that I was
educated, first of all at Clifton College, then at an
Army crammer’s, and finally at Chedwode Crawley’s
well-known coaching establishment in Ely Place, Dublin.
There I read for the Royal Irish Constabulary, and,
attending regularly, remained for a little over two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
years. I can safely say these two years were two of
the happiest I have ever known, for my companions at
that time were the nicest set of fellows I have ever met,
and amongst them I formed many lifelong friendships.</p>

<p>When I was not working, I usually spent my time
playing football or cricket, to both of which sports I
was devoted, and, when I was not thus engaged, I used
to tramp across hill and dale continually exploring the
country in search of adventure.</p>

<p>But in those days I did not look for ghosts—they
came to me; they came to me then, as they had come
to me before, and as they have come to me ever since.</p>

<p>With my early experiences of the Unknown—which
experiences, by the way, extend over the whole period
of my youth—I have dealt fully in former works; so
that in this volume I propose to confine myself to later
experiences, commencing approximately with my début
as an investigator of haunted houses and superphysical
occurrences in general.</p>

<p>To begin with, however, let me state plainly that I
lay no claims to being what is termed a scientific
psychical researcher. I am not a member of any august
society that conducts its investigations of the other
world, or worlds, with test tube and weighing apparatus;
neither do I pretend to be a medium or consistent
clairvoyant.</p>

<p>I am merely a ghost hunter; merely one who honestly
believes that he inherits in some degree the faculty of
psychic perceptiveness from a long line of Celtic ancestry;
and who is, and always has been, deeply and
genuinely interested in all questions relative to phantasms
and a continuance of individual life after physical
dissolution. Moreover, in addition to this psychic
faculty, I possess, as I have already hinted, a spirit of
adventure; and since this spirit is irresistible, had I
not decided to become a ghost hunter, I should doubtless
have embarked upon some other and hardly less exciting
pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The actual cause of my decision to adopt ghost-hunting
as a profession was an experience which befel
me in the summer of ’92. I was at that time a student
in Ely Place, Dublin, and being in search of rooms, was
recommended to try a house within a stone’s throw of
the Waterloo Road.</p>

<p>A widow named Davis, with two leviathan daughters,
Mona and Bridget, ran the establishment, and as the
vacant apartments were large, apparently well ventilated
and exceedingly moderate in price, I decided to take
them. Consequently, I arrived there with my luggage
one afternoon, and was speedily engaged in the tiring
and somewhat irritating task of unpacking.</p>

<p>When I retired to rest that first night, I certainly had
no thought of ghosts or anything in connection with
them; on the contrary, my mind was wholly occupied
with speculations as to how I should fare in the coming
weekly examination at Crawley’s, whether the extra
attention I had recently bestowed on mathematics would
be of any service to me, or whether, in spite of it, I
should again occupy my place at the bottom of the
class. I remember thinking, however, as I blew out the
light and turned into bed, that there was something
about the room now—though I could not tell what—that
I had not noticed by daylight; but I soon went
to sleep, and although I awoke several times before
morning—a phenomenon in itself—I cannot say that I
thought then of any superphysical element in the
atmosphere. It was not until I had been there several
nights that the event occurred which effectually shaped
my future career.</p>

<p>One evening the two girls, Mona and Bridget, were
making so much racket in the room beneath me, that
I found work impossible, and being somewhat tired, for
I had stuck very close to it all day, I resolved to go to
bed. On my way thither I encountered two young men,
T.C. students, who were also lodging in the house, hotly
engaged in an argument; and they appealed to me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
express an opinion. I told them what I thought, as
they followed me upstairs; then, when I reached my
room, I abruptly bade them good-night, and, entering,
locked the door behind me.</p>

<p>Sitting down on the edge of the bed, I quietly slipped
off my clothes and put out the light. The two men
were still haranguing one another for all they were
worth when I got in between the sheets and prepared
to lie down. The room was not entirely dark; from
between the folds of the thick plush curtains that
enveloped the windows stray beams from the powerful
moonlight filtered through and battled their way to the
foot of the bed. I was looking at them with some
degree of curiosity, when I saw something move. I
glanced at it in astonishment, and, to my unmitigated
horror, the shape of something dark and sinister rose
noiselessly from the floor and came swiftly towards me. I
tried to shout, but could not make a sound. I was completely
paralysed, and as I sat there, sick with fear and
apprehension, the thing leaped on to me, and, gripping
me mercilessly by the throat, bore me backwards.</p>

<p>I gasped, and choked, and suffered the most excruciating
pain. But there was no relaxation—the pressure of
those bony fingers only tightened and the torture went on.
At last, after what seemed to me an eternity, there was a
loud buzzing in my ears, my head seemed to spin round
violently, and my brain to burst. I lost consciousness.
On coming to, I found that my assailant had left me. I
struck a light. My fellow-lodgers were still going at one
another hammer and tongs—and the door was, as I had
left it, locked on the inside. I searched the room thoroughly;
the window was bolted; there was nothing in the
cupboard; nothing under the bed; nothing anywhere.
I got into bed again, full of the worst anticipations, and,
if sleep came to me, it was only in the briefest snatches.</p>

<p>At dawn the room became suffused with a cold, grey
glow, and the suggestion of something horribly evil
standing close beside the bed and sardonically watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
me impressed me so strongly that, yielding to a sudden
impulse of terror, I hid my head under the bed-clothes,
and remained in that undignified position till the
morning was well advanced and I was “called.”</p>

<p>I got up, feeling downright ill, and although the
sunlight metamorphosing everything now made the
mere thought of a ghost simply ludicrous, I hurried out
of the room as speedily as possible. Nor did I venture to
pass another night there.</p>

<p>My landlady did not demur when I asked her to
transfer me to another apartment, and later, before I
took my final departure from her house, she confessed to
me that it was haunted. She believed that it had been
used as a private home for mentally afflicted people, and
that someone, either one of the patients or a nurse—she
did not know which—had died, under extremely painful
circumstances, in the room I had first occupied.</p>

<p>The Davises left the house soon after I did, and who
lives there now, and whether the hauntings still continue,
I cannot say. When I last made enquiries, about two
years ago, I learned that the then occupants had never
admitted experiencing anything unusual, but that they
always kept the room in which I had undergone the
sensations of strangulation carefully locked.</p>

<p>This adventure of mine, intensely unpleasant as it had
been at the time, profoundly interested me. Hitherto I
had placidly accepted as truth all the dogmas of religion
hurled at me from the pulpit and drilled into me at
school, for the simple reason that I had always been
taught to regard as infinitely correct and absolutely
above criticism all that the clergy told me: God made
the world, they said, and all the laws and principles
appertaining to it—that was sufficient—I need not ask
any questions. When I looked about me and saw men,
and women, dogs, horses, and other animals suffering
indescribable agonies from all kinds of foul and malignant
diseases; when I encountered cripples, the maimed and
blind, idiots and lunatics; or read in the papers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
swindles, murders and suicides; or noted how, throughout
nature, the strong animals prey upon the weak;
how, for example, the tiger, the lion and the leopard
terrorize the jungle, just as the shark and octopus
terrorize the sea, and the wasp and spider, centipede and
scorpion terrorize insect life (being furnished respectively
with weapons for tearing and rending, and sucking the
flesh, and entailing the most excruciating tortures on the
nerve centres); when, I say, I noted all this, I was
given to understand that I must on no account comment
upon it—to do so was impious and wicked—I
must abide by the precept of my pastor and pedagogue,
namely, that “God is almighty and merciful, loving
and wise.”</p>

<p>But now it was different—I was no longer in the
schoolroom, no longer under the immediate influence of
the Church. I met people in Dublin imbued with the
broader instincts of a big, cosmopolitan community; I
listened to their reasoning—reasoning which at first
immeasurably shocked me, and afterwards struck me as
horribly sane. Then, at this crisis, came the incident of
the strangling. I tried to attribute it to a dream, but I
was prevented by the fact that I had only just got into
bed, and had not even lain down, when the figure seized
me. Hence, I could only conclude that some spirit—the
nature of my suffering and the horror it inspired leading
me to suppose that it was a particularly evil one—had
been my aggressor.</p>

<p>But why was it not in Hell? Had it escaped in spite of
the strict supervision of the Almighty? Or could it be
possible that the orthodox Paradise and Purgatory did
not exist, and that the spirits of the dead were allowed
to wander about at will? I became interested—deeply
so; all sorts of wild speculations floated through my
mind; I resolved to enquire further.</p>

<p>I would not be guided by any creed; I would set out
on my work of investigation wholly unbiassed; I would
gain whatever knowledge there was to be gained of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
another world without the aid either of priest or occultist,
medium or scientist.</p>

<p>Several of my friends in Dublin were greatly interested
in ghosts, and I learned from them of two houses that
had long borne the reputation of being haunted. One
was close to St. Stephen’s Green, within sight of the
Queen’s Service Academy, and the other, a big, ugly
edifice of a dingy grey, was in Blackrock. I had stayed
in the former when a child, and had vivid recollections
of the holes in the stone stairs, through which boiling oil
was poured on the heads of the English soldiers at the
time of the ’98.</p>

<p>There were many large and stately rooms in the house,
oak-panelled and beautified throughout with much
carving. I remember looking with awe and perplexity at
the number of odd shadows that used to put in an
appearance on the stairs and in the passages, just when
it was my bed-time, but I did not then attribute them to
ghosts. I simply did not know what they were. I heard
sounds, too—clangs and clashes, and footsteps tramping
up and down the stairs; sounds I did not attempt to
analyse, possibly because I dared not. That was in 1886;
I was then a small boy, and now—now only—after I had
long left the house, and was back in Dublin, with the
experience of the strangling ghost still fresh in my mind,
I began to wonder whether these strange sounds and
shadows might not have been due to the presence of the
Superphysical. I mentioned the matter to my friends,
and they expressed astonishment that I had not heard
the house was haunted. One of them, a lady, told me
that she had once stayed there and had been awakened
every night by the sounds I had described—the sounds of
heavy footsteps rushing up the stairs, of cries and groans,
shrieks and oaths, coupled with the clashing of scabbards
and sword blades, and the sound as of falling bodies.</p>

<p>Yet nothing was ever to be seen, saving the moonlight
and shadows—plenty of shadows—shadows strangely
suggestive of grotesque and fancifully clad people. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
tried to obtain permission to sleep in the house, and in
my innocence of the ways of landlords, I stated with the
most pathetic candour my true intention—I wanted to
investigate. The reply I got was certainly not courteous,
neither did it permit of argument. Hence, feeling considerably
crestfallen and humiliated, I found myself
forced to give up my first attempt at ghost-hunting.</p>

<p>Then I turned my attention to the house in Blackrock,
and fared no better. The landlord had been bothered to
death with requests to spend nights there, and was
endeavouring to discover the originator of the report
that the place was haunted, in order that he might
bring an action for Slander of Title. Consequently I could
only examine the house from the outside, hoping that its
ghostly inhabitants would one night take pity on me and
exhibit themselves at one of the windows. But in this,
too, I was disappointed; although, as the place invariably
inspired me with the greatest dread, I have no doubt
whatever but that it was genuinely and badly haunted.</p>

<p>There were several stories in circulation in Dublin
about that time concerning the nature of the haunting,
and the following—one of the most reliable—was told me
by a Mrs. Blake. I will give it as nearly as I can in her
own words:</p>

<p>“When I was a child of about twelve,” she began,
“which was a good many years ago, my father, who was
then stationed in Dublin, took the house on a three
years’ lease, at a very low rental, due, so the owner
stated, to the fact that there were far too many stairs, a
feature to which most people, on account of their
servants, strongly objected. Nothing was said about
ghosts, and nothing was further from my parents’ minds
when they took possession. We moved in towards the
end of July, but it was not until the middle of September
that we first became aware that the house was haunted.
It happened in this way: My father and the maids were
out one evening, and only my mother, my small brother
and I were in the house. It was about eight o’clock. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was upstairs in the nursery reading to Teddy, and my
mother was in the drawing-room, two storeys beneath.
I was just in the middle of a sentence, when Teddy
interrupted me. ‘Did you hear that?’ he exclaimed;
‘it’s someone on the stairs. I believe they are listening.’
I paused, and heard a loud creak. ‘Who can it be?’ I
said; ‘there’s only mother in the house!’ Much
mystified, I closed the book and went out on to the
landing. No one was there; but when I got to the head
of the stairs, I heard a loud scream, and then a dull thud,
just as if someone had fallen. In an agony of mind I ran
downstairs to see what had happened. As I arrived in
the hall, the door of the drawing-room was slowly
opened, and I saw, peeping cautiously out, a white face
with two dark, gleaming, obliquely-set eyes, that filled
with an expression of the most diabolical hatred as they
met mine. I was so terrified that I started back some
paces, and, as I did so, the door opened a little wider, and
the figure of a short, elderly woman, clad in an old-fashioned
black dress, and white cap crumpled closely
round her lean, haggard face, glided out, and, passing by,
ascended the stairs. As she came to the first bend, she
turned, and looking down at me with an evil leer, shook
her hand menacingly at me. She then passed out of
sight, and I heard her climb the stairs, step by step, till
she came to the nursery landing. A moment later, and
Teddy gave a violent shriek.</p>

<p>“My terror was now so great that I think I should have
gone mad had I been left there any longer by myself;
but, by a merciful providence, a key turned in the lock of
the front door, and my father entered. The sight of his
well-known figure on the threshold at once loosened the
spell that had bound me, and with a cry of delight I
clutched him by the arms, imploring him to see at once
what had happened to mother and Teddy.</p>

<p>“He ran into the drawing-room first and found my
mother on the floor, just reviving from a faint. Lighting
the gas, he fetched her some brandy, and then, bidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
me stay with her, he hastened upstairs to Teddy. The
latter was very badly frightened, and it was some days
before he was well enough to give anything like a
coherent account of what had happened. Of course,
mother and father told Teddy that the queer figure they
had seen was some friend of the servants, who had called
while they were out, but I suppose they deemed me old
enough to know the truth, for they discussed the incident
openly in my presence. It appears that my mother had
been quietly knitting in the drawing-room, when she
suddenly felt very cold, and rising from her chair, with
the intention of closing the door, found herself confronted
by a hideous form. Subsequently, my father made a
thorough search of the house, but he found no one, and as
all the windows were fastened and the doors locked on
the inside, we could only come to the conclusion that the
figure my mother and Teddy and I had all seen was a
ghost. A few days later it appeared to my father. He was
coming out of his bedroom, when he saw a woman steal
stealthily out of a room on the same landing and creep
downstairs in front of him. There was something about
her so intensely sinister that he felt chilled; but, determining
to find out who she was, he followed her, and
catching her up, demanded her name. There was a chuckling
answer, the figure instantly disappeared, and a number
of invisible somethings clattered down the stairs past him.</p>

<p>“I think my father was very scared; at all events he
came into the breakfast-room with a very white face and
ate hardly anything. Some time after this, when the
autumn was well advanced, my uncle came to stay with
us. He was a jolly, rollicking sailor, who had fought the
Turks at Navarino, and had had many exciting adventures
with Chinese pirates.</p>

<p>“No one told him the house was haunted; it was
decided he should find that out for himself. One afternoon,
several days after his arrival, he was taking off his
boots in a room in the basement, when a current of icy
air blew in on him, and, on raising his eyes to see whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the draught came, he perceived an extraordinarily pretty
girl, clad in a dark green riding-habit, such as he believed
were worn in the days of his great grand-parents, standing
in the doorway, watching him intently. ‘This is one of
Jack’s surprises’ (Jack was my father), he said to
himself, ‘and a deuced pleasant one, too! The rogue,
he knows nothing pleases me so much as the sight of a
pretty girl, and, by Jove, she is pretty!’ Springing to
his feet—for my uncle was never bashful in the presence
of the fair sex—he advanced to shake hands. To his
chagrin, however, she promptly turned round, and,
walking swiftly away, began to ascend the stairs. My
uncle followed her. On and on she led him till she came
to the drawing-room; there she paused, and with the
forefinger of her left hand on her lips, glanced coyly
round at him. She then quietly turned the door handle,
and signalling to him to follow, stole into the room on
tiptoe. Charmed with this piece of acting, the naïvety of
it appealing very strongly to his susceptible nature, my
uncle hastened after her. The moment he crossed the
threshold, however, he recoiled. Standing in the middle
of the room was an old woman with a hideous, white face
and black, leering eyes. There were no signs anywhere
of the young and beautiful lady. She had completely
vanished. My uncle was so shocked by the spectacle
before him that he retreated on to the landing, and, as he
did so, the drawing-room door swung to with a loud
crash. He called my father, and they entered the room
together; but it was quite empty, the old hag had disappeared
as inexplicably as the girl. That evening there
was to be a party, and the table in the dining-room
groaned beneath the weight of one of those inimitable
‘spreads,’ in vogue some fifty or sixty years ago. With
somewhat pardonable pride my mother took us all—my
father, uncle and myself—to have a peep at it, before the
guests arrived. As we drew near the room, we heard, to
our astonishment, the plaintive sound of a spinet. My
mother instantly drew back, trembling, whereupon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
uncle, forcing a laugh, said, ‘This is one of the occasions
upon which a gentleman should go first.’ He threw open
the door as he spoke, and we all peered in. What I saw
will never be effaced from my memory. The room
exhibited a complete wreckage—the cloth was half off
the table, the massive silver candlesticks were overturned,
and the floor was strewn with piles of broken
glass, china and eatables—everything was smashed and
ruined. In the midst of the debris, her face turned
towards us, lay a very beautiful girl. There were unmistakable
evidences of a ghastly wound, but her eyes
were partly open, and the strange light which gleamed
from their blue depths revealed an expression which
could only have been hatched in hell—a hell, peopled not
with passive torture-torn sufferers, but with wholly
abandoned beings actively engaged in licentiousness and
everything that is destructive and antagonistic to man’s
moral and mental progress. Standing over the woman,
and holding a kind of stiletto in his hand, was a tall, fair
man, in whose agonised and remorseful features we
recognised at once a most startling likeness to my uncle.
No detail was wanting—there was the deep scar on the
temple, the curiously deep dimple in the chin; indeed,
saving for the old-fashioned clothes, no likeness could
have been more exact. Standing by his side, her hideous,
scowling face thrust forward, her evil eyes glaring at us
with the same vindictive insolence, was the old woman I
had seen that night in the hall. Then, my father,
uttering some exclamation, crossed himself, and, as he
did so, the figures abruptly vanished, whilst the whole
house echoed and re-echoed with loud peals of mocking,
diabolical laughter. That was the finale; we left immediately
afterwards, and from that day to this the house,
I believe, has stood almost uninterruptedly empty.”</p>

<p>This is the gist of Mrs. Blake’s account of the happenings,
and as I never found her anything but strictly
truthful, I believe them to have been given me without
any conscious exaggeration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subt">I AM PURSUED BY PHANTOM FOOTSTEPS</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Before</span> I left the west of Ireland, I set out one day to
investigate a case of haunting by fairies, which was
alleged to take place nightly at the junction of four cross
roads on the southern slope of the Wicklow mountains.</p>

<p>I found a spot that seemed to correspond with the
description of the scene of the haunting given me by my
informant, and kept a vigil there for two consecutive
nights without experiencing any of the anticipated
results. However, I intended giving the place another
trial, and accordingly set out; but when within half a
mile or so of my destination, I began to feel very tired,
and having a bad cold on me besides, I decided to put
up at a cottage I espied a short distance off, instead of
pursuing my way further.</p>

<p>The cottage stood a little back from the main road,
perhaps a hundred yards or so, and was connected with it
by a narrow lane. The situation was one of intense loneliness;
the nearest village was a good two miles away,
and few people, other than occasional cyclists, ever
passed along the high road after nightfall. At the time
I am speaking of, the cottage was tenanted by a couple
named Mullins. The man was a drover, and his wife
one of the tallest women I have ever seen; she possessed,
moreover, a pair of green-grey eyes, and these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
remarkable, not only for their curious colouring, but for
the impression they gave one that they were perpetually
trying not to see too much. Apart from these peculiarities,
she seemed ordinary enough, and I felt I was in the
house of very worthy and hard-working people.</p>

<p>I went to bed early and was given the only spare room
in the cottage. It faced the front and was immediately
over the tiny parlour. As the linen was spotless and felt
thoroughly dry, I had no scruples about getting in
between the sheets, and, stretching myself out, I was
soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>I awoke with violent palpitations of the heart to find
the room bathed with moonlight; and, as all was absolutely
silent, I concluded it must be far on into the
night. Suddenly I heard footsteps—footsteps in the
distance, running at a well-regulated pace. They rang
out sharp and clear in the still air, and gradually became
more and more distinct. I was wondering who the
person could be, out at such an hour, when a dog, apparently
in the yard at the back of the house, set up the
most unearthly howling. The next moment I heard Mrs.
Mullins speak, and, inadvertently, I listened.</p>

<p>“John,” she said, “do you hear the dog?”</p>

<p>“I should be deaf and dumb if I didn’t,” Mullins
replied sleepily. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“What is it, indeed! Why the dog never barks like
that unless there is a spirit about. Do you remember
those knocks on the door the night Uncle Mike died, and
how the dog howled then? There’s something of the
same sort about to-night. Listen!”</p>

<p>The steps very were near now. I listened intently.
The runner, I thought, must be wearing very extraordinary
boots, for every step, so it seemed to me, was
accompanied by a peculiar and almost metallic click.</p>

<p>“John,” Mrs. Mullins suddenly resumed, “do you hear
those steps? What are they? It’s the first time in my life
I’ve heard anyone running along the high road like that
at this time of night. Hark! They’ve got to the turning—they’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the lane—they’re coming here! Get up at
once; go and bolt the front door. The thing’s evil—evil,
I’m sure, and it’s someone of us here it’s after.”</p>

<p>The steps grew rapidly nearer, and Mullins, stumbling
hastily down the stairs, bolted both the doors and swung
to the little wooden shutters. A moment later, and I
heard the steps come right up to the door. There was a
momentary pause, then a series of terrific knocks.</p>

<p>“Cross yourself, John; for God’s sake cross yourself!”
Mrs. Mullins cried. “And may the Holy Virgin protect
us.” She then started praying loudly and vehemently,
and, whether it was the effect of her prayers or not, the
knocking gradually diminished in violence, and then
ceased altogether.</p>

<p>“Come on up, John,” Mrs. Mullins called out; “the
thing, whatever it is, has ceased troubling us, and we
may go to sleep in peace.”</p>

<p>Mullins, needing no second bidding, joined his wife,
and once again the whole place was wrapped in silence.</p>

<p>I must confess that, whilst the knocking continued, I
had no desire whatever to look out of the window, but
the moment it was over I got up and peered out. I could
see right down the lane and for some distance along the
high road.</p>

<p>There was no sign of anyone or anything that could in
any way account for the disturbance—the landscape was
brilliantly illuminated with moonlight, every stick and
stone being plainly visible, and all nature seemed to be
sleeping undisturbedly, as if no interruption in its
ordinary routine had occurred. I got back into bed, and,
falling into a gentle doze, slept soundly till the morning.
After breakfast, Mrs. Mullins said, “You’re not thinking
of spending another night here, sir, are you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” I replied. “I must be back in Dublin at
my work by this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that, sir,” she went on; “because I
couldn’t let you stay. I suppose you heard the rapping,
sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did,” I replied; “and the footsteps—how do you
account for them?”</p>

<p>“Only in one way,” she said; “they came after you.
At least, that was my impression, and my impressions are
seldom wrong. I seemed to see some terrible form—half
animal and half human—something indescribably
grotesque and unnatural—something, my instinct tells
me, was wanting to get at you.”</p>

<p>Her description of the figure reminded me so strongly
of the queer thing that tried to strangle me in the house
near the Waterloo Road, that I narrated my experience
to her.</p>

<p>“You may depend upon it, sir,” she said when I had
finished, “that the ghost you have just told me about
and the one that came to the cottage last night are the
same. I have heard that spirits will sometimes attach
themselves to persons who have been staying in the
house they haunt, and that they will leave the house with
them and follow them wherever they go. I only hope
and trust that this one will never do you any harm, and
that you will succeed in ridding yourself of it, but my
husband and I feel, asking your pardon, that we should
not like to have you sleep here again.”</p>

<p>I did not tell her that even had she been willing,
nothing on earth would have induced me to stay, for
whether she was right in her theory about the steps or
not, the neighbourhood had lost all its charms for me.
Indeed, when next I had a ghostly visitation, I hoped I
should be quartered in a less isolated spot.</p>

<p>My aunt, Mrs. Meta O’Donnell, tells me that a relative
of hers once had a remarkable encounter with fairies on
the road between Ballinanty and the village of Hospital
in County Limerick.</p>

<p>He was driving home one evening in his jaunting car,
unaccompanied save by his servant, Dunkley, who was
sitting with his back to him, when a number of little
people—fairies—sprang on the car, and clambering up,
tried to pull him off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding that, owing to the vigour with which they
pulled, he was actually slipping from his seat, he appealed
to his servant for assistance; and the latter, doing as he
was told, held on to him with all his strength, and thus
prevented the little people from dragging him to the
ground. Mrs. Meta O’Donnell is absolutely sure that
her relative never took stimulants of any sort, and that
he was in a perfectly normal state of mind when this
event happened.</p>

<p>Nor is this road haunted only by fairies, for Mrs. Meta
O’Donnell again tells me that this same relative of hers,
when driving home on another occasion—this time with
several friends—saw a man on horseback, in a hunting
coat, suddenly leap the hedge, and, after riding for some
distance by the side of the car, abruptly vanish. Two of
the men who were with him, she believes, also witnessed
this phenomenon.</p>

<p>It is a long step, seemingly, from the fairy to the
banshee, but these two types of spirit have at least one
trait in common, namely, exclusiveness; and the banshee,
even more emphatically than the fairy, will have nought
to do with the alien. It will attach itself only to the
family of bona-fide Irish origin, only to the clan that has
been associated with Irish soil for many generations.</p>

<p>With the kind permission of Mr. Ralph Shirley, I will
here introduce, making only slight alterations, a few
extracts from an article of mine on the banshee, which
appeared in the “Occult Review” for September, 1913:</p>

<p>“Contemporary with fairies and the Feni, phantoms
typical of the great lone hills of Wicklow and Connemara,
and of the bare and wind-bitten cliffs of Galway, may well
have been the banshees, which, attaching themselves for
divers reasons to various chieftains and sons of chieftains,
eventually became recognised as family ghosts or
familiars.</p>

<p>“Many people have fallen in the error of imagining all
banshees are moulded after one pattern. Nothing could
be more fallacious. The banshee of the O’Rourkes, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
example, does not resemble that of the O’Donnells;
there are many forms of the banshee, each clan having a
distinct one—or more than one—of its own. Some of
the banshees are fair to look at, and some old, and foul,
and terrifying; but their mission is invariably the same,
<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, to announce a death or some great family
catastrophe.</p>

<p>“The banshee is never joyous; it is always either sad
or malevolent. Sometimes it wails once, sometimes three
times—the wail in some degree, but not altogether,
resembling that of a woman in great trouble or agony;
sometimes, again, it groans; and sometimes it sighs, or
sings. In some clans the demonstrations are both
visual and auditory, in others only visual; and in
others, again, only auditory. There is no really old clan
but has its banshee, and few members of that clan who
are not, at some time or other of their lives, made aware
of it.</p>

<p>“How well I recollect as a child being told by those
who had experienced it, that a dreadful groaning and
wailing had been heard the night prior to the death of a
very near relative of mine in Africa. I enquired what
made the wailing, and was informed ‘the banshee,’ or
the ghost woman, who never fails to announce the death
of an O’Donnell.</p>

<p>“Years later, when in the extreme West of England,
my wife and I were awakened one night by a terrible wail,
which sounded just outside our door. Beginning in a
low key, it rose and rose, until it ended in a shrill scream,
that in time died away in a horrible groan. The idea of
the banshee at once flashed through my mind, for I felt
none other but a banshee could have made such a sound.</p>

<p>“Still, to satisfy my wife, I jumped out of bed and
went on to the landing; all was dark and silent, and
outside their bedrooms were assembled the rest of the
household, terrified, and eager to have an explanation of
what had happened. We searched the whole house and
the waste land outside, but there was nothing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
could in any way account for the noise, and in the
morning I received news of the death of someone very
closely related to me.... Whilst some writers are
inclined to treat the subject jocularly, and attribute the
banshee either to obviously absurd physical causes, or to
the abnormally imaginative powers they insist are the
birthright of all Irishmen, others dive into the pseudo-profound
compilations of modern Theosophy, and reappear
with the pronouncement that banshees are not
spirits at all—not entities hailing from the superphysical
world—but mere thought germs, created by some
remote ancestor of a clan, and wafted down from one
generation to another of his descendants, an idea as
nonsensical as it is extravagant, and which will not for
an instant hold water when looked into by those who
have had a bona-fide experience of the banshee or any
other ghostly phenomenon. Indeed, it is only the latter
who are capable of making observations of any value on
such a subject, and all effort to describe or account for
the superphysical by those who have never experienced
it, no matter whether those efforts are made by theosophical
savants, professional mediums or scientific
experts, are, in my opinion, weightless, colourless and
futile.</p>

<p>“A geologist may describe the hydrosphere, and an
astronomer the moon, and their descriptions may be
swallowed with tolerable composure and assurance,
because we know that the laws of similarity and analogy,
when applied to the physical, generally hold good; but
no scientist can teach us anything about spiritual
phenomena, because such things are actually without
the realm of science, just as the game of marbles is
entirely without the province of theology. It is our
sensations, and our sensations <em>only</em>, that can guide and
instruct us when dealing with the superphysical. I have
heard the dying screams of a woman murdered beneath
my window; I have heard on hill and plain the cries of
coyottes, panthers, jackals and hyenas; and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
many times listened to the dismal hooting of night birds,
when riding alone through the seclusion of giant forests;
but there is something in the banshee’s cry that differs
from all these, that fills one with a fear and awe, far—immeasurably
far—beyond that produced by a sound
which is merely physical. Imagine then what it is to be
haunted all one’s life by such a grim harbinger of woe,
to have it ever trailing in one’s wake, always ready and,
maybe, eager to make itself heard the moment it
detects, by its extraordinary and unhuman powers, the
advent of death. One curious idiosyncrasy of the banshee
is that it never manifests itself to the person whose death
it is prognosticating. Other people may see or hear it,
but the doomed one never, so that when every one
present is aware of it but one, the fate of that one may be
regarded as pretty well certain.</p>

<p>“And now once again, whence comes the banshee?
From heaven or from hell? What is it? It is impossible
to say; at the most one can only speculate. Some
banshees appear to be mournful only; others unquestionably
malevolent; and whereas some very closely
resemble a woman, even though of a type long passed
away, others, again, differ so much from our conception
of any human being, that we can only imagine them to
be spirits that never have been human, that belong to a
genus wholly separate and distinct from the human
genus, and that have only been brought into contact
with this material plane through the medium of certain
magical or spiritual rites practised by the Milesians, but
for some unknown reason discontinued by their descendants.
This appears to me quite a possible explanation
of the origin of the banshee.</p>

<p>“One realizes, when dabbling in spiritualism to-day,
one of the greatest dangers incurred is that of attracting
to one certain undesirable, mischievous, and malignant
spirits—call them elementals if you will—which, when
so attracted, stick to one like the proverbial leech. And
what happens to-day may very well have happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
thousands of years ago; in all probability, the Unknown
never changes; its ways and habits may be as constant as
those of Nature, guided by laws and principles which
may at times vary, but which, nevertheless, undergo no
material alteration. The superphysical, attracted to the
ancients as it is attracted to us to-day, would adhere to
them as it now adheres to us. I cannot surmise more.</p>

<p>“Supposing then that this theory accounts for the one
class of banshee, what accounts for the other—the other
that so nearly tallies with the physical? Are the latter
actual phantoms of the dead; of those that died some
unnatural death, and have been earth-bound and clan-bound
ever since? Maybe they are. Maybe they are
the spirits of women, prehistoric or otherwise, who were
either suicides or were murdered, or who themselves committed
some very heinous offence; and they haunt the
clan to which they owed their unhappy ending; or, in
the event of themselves being the malefactors, the clan
to which they belonged. From all this we can conclude
that, whilst the origin and constitution of banshees vary,
their mission is always the same—they are solely the
prognosticators of misfortune. A sorry possession for
anyone; and yet, how truly in accord with the nature of
the country—with its general air of discontent and
barrenness, with its rain-sodden soil and gloomy atmosphere—as
an unkind critic might say, could anyone
imagine the presence of cheerful spirits under such
conditions?</p>

<p>“But the banshee has the one admirable trait which
the average Englishman obstinately refuses to recognize
in the material Irish—the trait of loyalty and constancy.
It never forsakes the object of its attachment, but clings
to it in all its vicissitudes and peregrinations with a
loyalty and persistency that is unmatchable. It is
thoroughly Irish, essentially Irish; the one thing, apart
from disposition and character, that has remained
exclusively Irish through long centuries of robbery and
oppression; and which, in spite of assertions to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
contrary, never has been, nor ever will be shared by
other than the genuine clansman.</p>

<p>“The banshee is most fastidious in its tastes—it will
have none of the pseudo-celt; none of the individual
who, possessing an absolutely English name, and coming
entirely of English forefathers, terms himself Irish
merely because his ancestors happen to have settled in
Ireland. That is nothing like exact enough for the
banshee. Others may talk of it and write of it, but they
can never honestly claim it; for the banshee belongs
wholly and exclusively to the bona-fide O’s and Macs—and
them, and them only, will it never cease to haunt so
long as there is one of them left.”</p>

<p>My last experience with a ghost in Dublin took place
just after I had been medically examined for the R.I.C.,
and to my intense grief had been rejected, owing to
varicose veins, which the examining doctor told me
were of a far too complicated nature to permit of an
operation; consequently, although I had been “cramming”
for two years, and my prospects of getting
through the literary examination were deemed extremely
fair, it was futile to go up for it, as all chance of my ever
being in the R.I.C. was now at an end.</p>

<p>On the night of my failure to pass the medical I had
gone to bed early, as I had a splitting headache, and,
after vain efforts, had at length succeeded in falling
asleep. I awoke just in time to hear a clock from somewhere
in the downstairs premises of the house—I was
then lodging in Lower Merrion Street—strike two, and
almost immediately afterwards there came a loud laugh,
just over my face, and so near to me that I seemed to feel
the breath of the laughter fan my nostrils. Nothing I
have ever heard before, or have ever heard since, was so
repulsive as that laugh—it was the very incarnation of
jeering, jibing mockery; of undying, inveterate hate. I
felt that nothing but a spirit of unadulterated evil could
have made such a noise, and that it had come to gloat
over my misfortunes—to let me know how greatly it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
rejoiced at the cruel blow I had suffered. I naturally
associated it with the ghost that had tried to strangle
me, and my heart turned sick within me at the thought
that such a horrible species of phantasm was still hovering
near me. Should I ever be free from it? I was not
quite so frightened, however, as I had been on the
occasion of its visit to me in the house near the Waterloo
Road, and determining to prevent myself from falling
into that kind of paralytic condition again, in which all
my muscles and faculties had remained alike spell-bound
and useless, I sat up. The room was in pitch darkness,
and everything was breathlessly still. I waited in this
posture for some seconds, my heart beating like a sledge-hammer,
and then, deriving assurance from the fact that
nothing happened, I got out of bed and struck a light.
The door was locked on the inside, and there was nothing
in hiding that could in any way account for the noise. I
went to the window, and, lifting it gently, peered out into
the street. There was no moon, but many stars and lamp-lights
enabled me to see that the street was absolutely
empty—not even a policeman was in sight. I leaned far
out, and from immediately beneath me, although no one
was visible, there suddenly commenced the sound of
running footsteps. Ringing out loud and clear, and
accompanied by a queer familiar clicking, they seemed to
follow the direction of the street towards Ely Place. I
wanted to get back to bed, for I was lightly clad, and the
air was cool and penetrating, but something compelled
me to keep on listening, and so I remained with my neck
craned over the window-sill, till the steps gradually grew
fainter and fainter, and suddenly ceased altogether.
And with their termination this early period of my
ghostly experiences in Dublin terminated, too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subt">SOME STRANGE CASES IN SCOTLAND</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">I returned</span> to England in that “tub-like” old relic of
mid-Victorian steamboats, “The Argo”—long since
defunct, but which for many years sailed to and from
Dublin and Bristol with as many passengers and cattle
as could be crammed, with any degree of safety, into her
dingy and clumsy-looking hulk. I remember the passage
well, for two of my fellow students were on board, and
we spent nearly all the time on deck, telling ghost tales,
and earnestly discussing the possibility of a future life.
In the end we made a solemn compact, whereby it was
agreed that the one who died first would try his level best
to give some kind of spirit demonstration to the other
two. Both my friends died within a few years of that
date, and within three weeks of each other. The one,
who had a commission in a cavalry regiment, was killed
at the Battle of Omdurman, and the other, who having
followed in the footsteps of his distinguished father, had
become a novelist of great promise, was kicked to death
by a horse. The day after the death of the former, as I
was busily engaged writing the first chapter of my novel,
“For Satan’s Sake,” a portion of the mantel-piece in the
room in which I was working suddenly fell with a loud
crash on to the grate. Of course, the incident may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
have had anything to do with the death of my friend,
but it was nevertheless remarkable, as previously nothing
in the nature of a flaw had been noticeable in the condition
of the mantel-piece. My other friend died—as I
subsequently learned, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, after the incident I am about
to narrate had occurred—at ten o’clock one Friday
morning, and that afternoon as I was changing for
football, the grandfather clock on the landing outside my
bedroom suddenly struck ten. I went to look, and the
hands pointed to three. There had been nothing amiss
with the striking before, and there was nothing amiss
with the striking after.</p>

<p>These were the only phenomena I experienced at the
time these two friends of mine died.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span></p>

<p>On arriving at Bristol, I spent some weeks in the West
of England and then journeyed north to Scotland. My
original intention had been to spend a few weeks with an
old Clifton friend of mine, whose father owned an estate
near Inverary; but, on arriving at Glasgow, I heard of
such a promising case of haunting in that city, that,
unable to resist the temptation of investigating it, I
decided to postpone my journey west. The case, as
outlined to me in the first instance, was <span class="nobreak">this:—</span></p>

<p>A Glasgow solicitor, named James McKaye, desirous of
taking a house close to his office, went one morning to
look at one in Duke Street. He went there alone, and,
carefully closing the front door behind him, proceeded to
wander from room to room, beginning with the basement.</p>

<p>As he was going upstairs to the first floor, he suddenly
heard footsteps following him. He turned sharply
round; there was no one there. Thinking this was odd,
but attributing it to the acoustic properties of the walls,
he continued his ascent. Having arrived on the first
landing, he went into one of the rooms. The steps
followed him. A brilliant idea then occurred to him—he
stamped his foot. There was no echo. He turned round
and went into the next room, and the steps once again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
accompanied him. Then he grew frightened. It was
broad daylight, the sun was shining brilliantly and the
birds were singing; but there was something in this
house that jarred on him horribly—a something that was
completely out of humour with the golden sunbeams and
the cheerful chirping of the sparrows. The day was
hot, and the sun was pouring in through the blindless
windows; but in spite of this the rooms were icy, and he
was deliberating whether it was worth while to explore
the house further, when he caught sight of a shadow on
the wall. It was not his own shadow. It was that of a
man with his arms stretched out horizontally on either
side of him, and whereas the right arm was complete in
every detail, the left had no hand. James McKaye now
yielded to an ungovernable terror and rushed frantically
out of the house.</p>

<p>One would naturally think that after all this McKaye
would have vowed never to go near the place again.
Nothing of the sort. The house fascinated him. He
could not get it out of his mind; he even dreamed of it;
dreamed of it in connection with some mystery that he
must solve—that he alone could solve. Besides, there
was not another house in the town so conveniently
situated, nor so cheap. Consequently, he took it, and
within a fortnight had moved in with all his family and
household goods. For the first few weeks everything
went swimmingly, and McKaye, who was shrewd, even
for a Scot, congratulated himself upon having made such
an excellent bargain.</p>

<p>Then occurred an incident which recalled sharply the
day he had first seen the place. He was writing some
letters one morning in his study, when the nurse-maid
entered, white and agitated. “Oh, do come to the
nursery, sir,” she implored; “the children are playing
with something that looks like a dog, and yet isn’t one.
I don’t know what it is!” And she burst out crying.</p>

<p>“You’re mad,” McKaye said sharply and, springing
to his feet, he ran upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching the nursery, the blurred outline of something
like a huge dog or wolf came out of the half-open
door, and raced past him, so close that he distinctly felt
it brush against his clothes.</p>

<p>Where it went he could not say; he was thinking of
the children, and did not stop to look. Oddly enough, the
children were not a bit afraid; on the contrary, they
were pleased and curious. “What a strange doggy it
was, Daddy!” they cried; “it never wagged its tail,
like other doggies, and whenever we tried to stroke it, it
slipped away from us—we never touched it once.”</p>

<p>Sorely puzzled, McKaye told his wife, and the two
decided that if anything further happened, they must
leave the house.</p>

<p>That night McKaye happened to sit up rather late;
at last he got up, and was about to turn off the gas, when
he felt his upstretched hand suddenly caught hold of by
something large and soft, that did not seem to have any
fingers. He was so frightened that he screamed; whereupon
his hand was instantly released, and there was a
loud crash overhead. Thinking something had happened
to his wife, he rushed upstairs, and found her sitting up
in bed and talking in her sleep. She was apparently
addressing a black, shadowy figure that was crouching
on the floor, opposite her. As McKaye approached, the
thing moved towards the wall, and vanished.</p>

<p>Mrs. McKaye then awoke, and begged her husband to
take her out of the house at once, as she had dreamed
most vividly that an appalling murder had been committed
there, and that the murderer had come out of the
room with outstretched hands, asking her to look at them.
McKaye, who had had quite enough of it, too, promised
to do as she wished, and before another twenty-four
hours had passed the house was once again empty.</p>

<p>These were the bare facts of the case, and as they were
given me by one of his clients, I had no difficulty in
obtaining an interview with Mr. McKaye, who, I was
told, still had the keys of the house. It was not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
so easy to obtain consent to spend a night on the premises,
and he would only permit me to do so on the condition
that he himself accompanied me, and that I promised to
keep the visit a profound secret.</p>

<p>The evening chosen for our enterprise proved ever
memorable.</p>

<p>The rain came down in torrents, and the wind—a
veritable tornado—made any attempt to hold up an
umbrella utterly impossible. Indeed, it was as much as I
could do to hold up myself, whilst, to add to my discomfort,
at almost every step I plunged ankle-deep in icy
cold puddles. At length, drenched to the skin, I arrived
at the house.</p>

<p>McKaye was standing on the doorstep, swearing
furiously. He could not, so he said, find the key. However,
he produced it now, and we were soon standing
inside, shaking the water from our clothes. Those were
the days before pocket flashlights had become general,
and we had to be content with candles.</p>

<p>We each lighted one, and at once commenced to
search the premises to make sure no one was in hiding.</p>

<p>The house, as far as I can recollect, consisted of four
storeys and a basement. None of the rooms were very
large; the wall-papers were hideous, and I remember
thanking my stars that I was not called upon to live in
such hopelessly inartistic quarters. McKaye asked me
if I could detect anything peculiar in the atmosphere,
but I could only detect extreme mustiness, and told him
so. I fancied he seemed very fidgety and ill at ease;
however, as he was a much older man than myself, and
had some experience of the house, I felt perfectly safe
with him. After we had been in all the rooms, we
descended to the ground floor, and commenced our vigil
on the staircase leading from the hall to the first landing.</p>

<p>“I think we stand more chance of seeing something
here than anywhere else,” McKaye said; “and in the
case of anything very alarming happening, we are close
to the front door.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill1"></a>
<img src="images/ill1.jpg" width="435" height="625" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>“We both looked in the direction he indicated”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke only half in fun and I observed that his fingers
twitched a good deal and that his eyes were never at rest.</p>

<p>“Oughtn’t we to put out the candles?” I said.
“Ghosts surely materialise much more readily in the
dark.” But he would not hear of it. All his experiences,
he said, had taken place in the light, and he believed only
spoof ghosts at séances required the opposite conditions.
Then he regaled me once more with all that had happened
during his occupation of the house. He was still telling
me, when there came a loud rat-rat at the door.</p>

<p>“That’s a policeman,” he said; “he must have seen
our light.” He spoke truly, for, when we opened the
door, a burly figure in helmet and cape stood on the step
and flashed his dripping bull’s-eye in our faces. On
hearing McKaye’s name the constable was instantly
appeased, and, when we mentioned ghosts, he laughed
long and loud. “Well, gentlemen,” he said, “you won’t
never be alarmed by a happarition so long as you have
that dog with you. I bet he would scare away any
number of ghosts, and burglars, too. If I may be so
bold as to ask, what breed do you call him? I’ve never
seen anything quite like him before,” and he waved his
lamp towards the stairs. We both looked in the direction
he indicated, and there, half way up the stairs, with its
face apparently turned towards us, was the black,
shadowy outline of some shaggy creature, which to me
looked not so much like a dog as a bear. It remained
stationary for a moment or so, and then, retreating
backwards, seemed to disappear into the wall.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, good-night,” the policeman said,
lowering his lamp, “it’s time I was going.” He turned
on his heel, and was walking off, when McKaye called
him back.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, constable,” he said, “and we’ll
come with you.”</p>

<p>He cast a swiftly furtive glance around him as he
spoke, then, blowing out the lights, he caught me by the
arm and dragged me away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the dog, sir,” the policeman said, as the front
door closed behind us with a bang; “it ain’t come out!”</p>

<p>“And it never will,” McKaye responded grimly.
“You have seen the ghost, constable, or at least one of
them.”</p>

<p>I have never had an opportunity of visiting the house
again, but for aught I know to the contrary, it still
stands there, and is still haunted.</p>

<p>From Glasgow I went on to Inverary, where I had the
most delightful time, fishing and shooting.</p>

<p>I then went to Perth, and there, quite by chance, met a
Mr. and Mrs. Rowlandson, who informed me that they
were just quitting a badly haunted house on the outskirts
of the town. The name of the house was
“Bocarthe.” It was their own, and had only been built
a year, but they could not possibly remain in it, they told
me, owing to the perpetual disturbance to which they
were subjected. They were just beginning a detailed
description of the manifestations, when I begged them
to desist. I would like, I explained, with their permission,
to investigate the case, and I thought it would
be better to do so without knowing the nature of the
hauntings, as in these circumstances—should my experience
happen to tally with theirs—there could be no
question either of suggestion or of imagination.</p>

<p>I had resolved to conduct all my investigations with an
absolutely open mind, and I intended, when once I had
satisfied myself that the phenomena were objective, to
try and alight upon some code whereby I could communicate
with them, and learn from them something
certain—something definite, at all events, about the
other world. To what extent I have succeeded I shall
make it the purpose of this volume to reveal.</p>

<p>But to continue: “What strikes us as so extraordinary
about the whole thing,” the Rowlandsons said,
“is that a new house, with absolutely no history
attached to it, for we were the first people who ever
inhabited it, and we can assure you,” they added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
laughingly, “there were no murders or suicides there
during our occupancy, should be haunted. Our neighbours
declare that we must have brought the ghost with
us.”</p>

<p>I told them I thought it quite possible that such might
be the case, and narrated to them my experiences in
Dublin. They appeared to be greatly interested; and
were, moreover, quite willing, provided I promised them
not to discuss the matter too openly, as they wanted to
let the house, that I should spend a few nights at
“Bocarthe.” They were, in fact, rather anxious to
know if anything unusual still took place there. Thinking,
perhaps, that I might not like to go alone, they gave me
an introduction to a young friend of theirs, Dr. Swinton,
who, they thought, might be prevailed upon to accompany
me; and, before I left them, all the preliminaries relating
to my visit to “Bocarthe” were satisfactorily arranged.</p>

<p>That same day the Rowlandsons went to Edinburgh,
where they told me they intended living, and the following
day at noon I wended my way to the house they had
vacated. As there was no story connected with
“Bocarthe,” I set to work to make enquiries about the
ground on which it stood, and instead of learning too
little, I learned too much. An old minister, who looked
fully eighty, was sure that the ground in question, until
it was built upon quite recently, had been grazing land
ever since he was a boy, and that it had never witnessed
anything more extraordinary than the occasional death
of a sheep or a cow that had been struck by lightning.
An equally aged and equally positive postmistress
declared that the ground had never been anything
better than waste land, where, amid rubbish heaps
galore, all the dogs in the parish might have been seen
scratching and fighting over bones. Another person
remembered a pond being there, and another a nursery
garden; but from no one could I extract the slightest
hint as to anything that could in any way account for
the haunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>When I entered the house, I thought I had seldom
seen such a cheerful one: the rooms were light and lofty,
and about them all there was an air of geniality, that
hitherto, at all events, I had never dreamed of associating
with ghosts.</p>

<p>Dr. Swinton joined me in the evening, but although we
sat up till long after dawn, we neither saw nor heard
anything we could not account for by natural causes. We
repeated the process for two more nights, and then,
feeling that we had given the house a fair trial, we
concluded it was either no longer haunted, or that the
hauntings were periodical, and might not occur again
for years. I wrote to Mr. Rowlandson, upon returning
the keys of the house, and, in reply, received the following
letter from <span class="nobreak">him:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="lttr">
<span class="lttr3">No. —, C—— Crescent,</span><br />
<span class="lttr4">Edinburgh.</span><br />
<span class="lttr2">November 8th, 1893.</span>
</p>

<p class="noi">Dear Mr. O’Donnell,</p>

<p class="ltt1">Many thanks for the keys. No wonder you did not
see our ghost! It is here, and we are having just the
same experiences in this house as we had in
“Bocarthe.” If you would care to stay a few nights
with us, on the chance of seeing the ghost, we shall be
delighted to put you up.</p>

<p class="lttr">
<span class="lttr5">Yours, etc.,</span><br />
<span class="lttr1">Robert Rowlandson.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>I was obliged to return home very shortly, in order to
decide definitely and speedily what I intended to do for a
living; but although I knew I had little or no time to
waste, I could not resist the Rowlandsons’ kind invitation
to try and see their ghost, and accordingly accepted.</p>

<p>They lived in C—— Crescent. When I arrived
there, I found the entire household in a panic, the ghost
having appeared to one and all during the previous
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was so terrible,” Mrs. Rowlandson said, “that I
can’t bear even to think of it, and shall certainly never
forget it. One of the maids fainted, and was so ill afterwards,
we were obliged to have the doctor, and all have
given notice to leave.”</p>

<p>“Did nothing of the sort happen before you went to
‘Bocarthe’?” I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>“No,” Mr. Rowlandson replied, “not a thing. We
were then sceptics where ghosts were concerned, but
we’re certainly not sceptical now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible,” I said, “that the ghost is
attached to some piece of old furniture? I have read of
such cases.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rowlandson shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “we have no old furniture, all our
furniture is modern and new; at least, it was new when
we came to ‘Bocarthe.’”</p>

<p>“Then, if the ghost is neither attached to the house,
nor to the ground, nor to the furniture, it must surely be
attached to some person,” I remarked. “I have read
that one of the dangers of attending Spiritualistic
Séances is that spirits occasionally attach themselves to
people, and can only be got rid of with great difficulty.
I suppose no one in the house has gone in for Spiritualism?”</p>

<p>“I can safely say I haven’t,” Mr. Rowlandson laughed;
“and you haven’t, either, Maud, have you?” he said,
looking at his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowlandson flushed.</p>

<p>“The only Spiritualist I ever knew,” she stammered,
“was—you know, dear, whom I <span class="nobreak">mean——”</span></p>

<p>Mr. Rowlandson raised his eyebrows and stared at her
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” he said. “Who?”</p>

<p>“Ernest Dekon!”</p>

<p>“Dekon!” Mr. Rowlandson ejaculated. “Dekon!
Why, of course, I might have guessed Spiritualism was
in his line. Some years ago, Mr. O’Donnell,” he went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
turning to me, “my wife met this Mr. Dekon at a ball
given by a mutual friend, and from that time, up to his
death, he persecuted her with his undesirable attentions.
I never knew anyone so persistent.”</p>

<p>“He resented your marriage, of course,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Resented it!” Mr. Rowlandson responded; “I
should rather think he did, though to everyone’s surprise
he came to it. Ye Gods! I shall never forget the expression
on his face, as we caught sight of him in the
vestibule of the church. Talk about Satan! Satan
never looked half as evil.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Dekon was a Spiritualist!” I said.</p>

<p>“He was very keen on séances,” Mrs. Rowlandson
interposed. “Most keen, and was at one time always
trying to persuade me to go to one with him.”</p>

<p>“I never knew that,” Mr. Rowlandson exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” his wife said demurely. “You see,
you don’t know everything. However, I never went.”</p>

<p>“And how did he die?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Suicide,” Mr. Rowlandson said. “He shot himself,
and was dastardly enough to leave a note behind him,
pinned to the toilet-cover of his dressing-table, stating
that his death was entirely due to the heartless conduct
of my wife.”</p>

<p>“When was that, Mr. Rowlandson?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” Mr. Rowlandson soliloquised. “We
have been married not quite eighteen months. About
fifteen months ago—shortly before we came to
‘Bocarthe.’”</p>

<p>“I know what’s in your mind,” Mrs. Rowlandson
observed. “You think that very possibly it is the spirit
of Ernest Dekon that is troubling us. Do you really
think it could be?”</p>

<p>“From what you have told me,” I said, “I should say
that it is more than likely. The mere fact of his having
been a Spiritualist would mean that he had, in some
measure, got in touch with the Unknown; so that on
passing over with his mind solely concentrated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
revenge, he would, in all probability, speedily become
closer acquainted with those spirits whom he had known
here—not a very high class, but apparently the only
class that a séance can attract—and these would undoubtedly
aid him in his attempt to come back and
annoy you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowlandson gave vent to an exclamation of
dismay. “I have always felt,” she said, “that there
might be some mysterious connection between Ernest
Dekon and the dreadful thing we have seen.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” I added, “that is only a suggestion on
my part. When does the phenomenon usually appear?”</p>

<p>“At all times, and when we least expect it,” Mrs.
Rowlandson said. “For example, if I am going upstairs
alone, it either springs out at me or peers down at me
from over the banisters. Or, again, it rouses us in the
middle of the night by rocking our bed! Always some
alarming trick of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Then you could hardly expect it to manifest itself
if we all sat here in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Hardly.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t a photograph of Mr. Dekon, I suppose?”
I hazarded.</p>

<p>“A photograph of that scoundrel,” Mr. Rowlandson
cried. “If he had given her one, it wouldn’t have
remained long in her possession, I can assure you.”</p>

<p>“Well, he never did,” Mrs. Rowlandson said, forcing
a smile, “but I can describe him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether that will do much good,” I
observed. “Because I understand that if one of the
lower order of earthbounds, usually called Elementals,
wanted to ‘fool’ us, it could easily impersonate him.
Dekon’s phantom would not, of necessity, be very like
his material body; it would depend entirely on how
much of the animal there was in him; if a great deal,
then one might expect to see a creature with a pig’s, or
some other kind of beast’s, head, with only a slight facial
resemblance to Dekon. Can you describe his hands?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Because I believe spirits that have lost all other resemblance
with the physical body might be identified by
some peculiarity in the formation of the fingers.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Rowlandson said; “I do remember his
hands distinctly. They were so ugly! They were long,
and red, and the tips were club-shaped; I am sure I
should recognise them anywhere.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place in the interval between
tea and dinner. After dinner we sat in the drawing-room,
discussing plans for the night, and finally came to
the conclusion that when bed-time came we should
retire to our respective rooms, and sit there in the dark,
waiting and watching for whatever might happen. It
was furthermore agreed that directly anyone saw or
heard anything, they should at once summon the others.</p>

<p>We sat up rather late, and it was close on midnight
before Mrs. Rowlandson rose, and we all—there were
two guests besides myself, a Colonel and Mrs. Rushworth—took
our candlesticks, and followed her upstairs. We
had mounted the first flight, and had turned the bend
leading to the second—the house seemed all stairs—when
Mrs. Rowlandson halted, and, looking back at us,
said, “Hush! Do you hear anything?”</p>

<p>We stood still and listened. There was a thump, that
apparently came from a room just at the top of the
stairs—then another—and then a very curious sound, as
if something was bounding backwards and forwards over
bare boards with its feet tied together. At a signal from
Mr. Rowlandson, we immediately blew out our lights.
A church clock solemnly struck twelve. We heard it
very distinctly, as the Rowlandsons, being enthusiasts
for fresh air, kept every window in the house wide open.
The reverberation of the final stroke had hardly ceased
when a loud gasp from someone in front of me sent a
chilly feeling down my spine.</p>

<p>At the same moment the darkness ahead of us was
dissipated by a faint, luminous glow. As I watched, the
glow speedily intensified, and suddenly took the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a cylindrical column of six or seven feet in height, and
this in turn developed with startling abruptness into the
form of something so shockingly grotesque and bestial
that I was rendered speechless.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to give a very accurate
description of it, because, like the generality of occult
phenomena I have experienced in haunted houses, it
was a baffling mixture of the distinct and yet vague,
entirely without substance, and apparently wholly
constituted of vibrating light that varied each second in
tone and intensity. I can only say that the impression
I derived was that of a very gross or monstrous man.</p>

<p>The head, ill-defined on the crown and sides, appeared
to be abnormally high and long, and to be covered with a
tangled mass of coarse, tow-coloured hair; the nose
seemed hooked, the mouth cruel, the eyes leering. The
general expression on the face was one of intense
antagonism. The body of the thing was grey and nude,
very like the trunk of a silver beech, the arms long and
knotted, the hands huge, the fingers red and club-shaped.
The latter corresponded exactly with Mrs.
Rowlandson’s description.</p>

<p>This hideous, baleful apparition was the spirit of
animal man, the symbolical representation of all carnal
lusts—it was Ernest Dekon—soulless.</p>

<p>But although this spirit was without substance, it
was composed of complex forces—forces both physical
and mental. It could shut and open doors, move
furniture, rap and make sundry other noises, and it could
also convey the sensation of intense cold, and the feeling
of the most abject fear. I now found myself wondering
if it possessed other properties: Was it sensible? Could
it communicate in any way?</p>

<p>I was thus deliberating, when the figure seemed to
move forward; then someone shrieked. Mr. Rowlandson
struck a light, and simultaneously the apparition
vanished. The effect it had had on us all was novel and
striking—we were all more or less demoralized; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
no two of us had seen the ghost the same—and some,
Mr. Rowlandson and Mrs. Rushworth, had not seen it
at all.</p>

<p>We went back again into the drawing-room and discussed
it. Mrs. Rowlandson was the first to speak. She,
too, had been particularly impressed by the hands, and
she was sure they were the hands of Ernest Dekon.</p>

<p>“I can say nothing about the face,” she cried, “as it
did not appear to me, but having seen the hands, I am
firmly convinced that the ghost is Ernest Dekon, and that
it is Ernest Dekon who is tormenting us. Can’t any of
you think of a plan to get rid of him?”</p>

<p>“Cremation is the only thing I can think of!” cried
Colonel Rushworth, who had hitherto been silent. “That
is the means employed, I believe, by the hill tribes in
Northern India. When a spirit—a spirit they can
identify—begins to haunt a place, they dig up the body
and burn it, and they say that as soon as the last bone
is consumed the haunting ceases. They have a theory
that phantoms of dead people and animals can materialise
as long as some remnant of their physical body remains.
Where did this Ernest Dekon die?”</p>

<p>“In Africa,” Mr. Rowlandson said.</p>

<p>“That’s capital! If we can find the cemetery, there
ought to be no difficulty in getting at the body. The
officials are, as a rule, open to bribery. Anyhow, we
might try it as an experiment.”</p>

<p>I left Edinburgh next day, but I heard some months
later from Mr. Rowlandson.</p>

<p>“You may recollect Colonel Rushworth’s suggestion,”
he wrote. “Well, the hauntings have ceased. We are
shortly returning to ‘Bocarthe’!”</p>

<p>From this I gathered that an attempt to exhume and
cremate Ernest Dekon’s body had been made, and had
proved successful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subt">I TRAVEL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND DO
SOME GHOST HUNTING IN SAN FRANCISCO</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Upon</span> leaving Scotland I seriously considered my future,
and at length decided to go to Oregon and fruit farm.
Though the expedition, through no fault of my own,
proved a failure, and I had to return to England within a
comparatively short time, I managed, whilst in America,
to see and learn a good deal. Apart from visiting Crater
Lake, which in those days was one of the wildest spots
imaginable, far out of the beat of any but the most
adventurous tourist, and seeing the Rogue River Indians
in their native element, I spent several weeks in the big
cities, and when in San Francisco obtained the services
of a guide, and did a nightly tour of China Town, and
several of the lesser known subterranean haunts of that
city.</p>

<p>It was in San Francisco that I had my first experience
with an American ghost. I had been out tramping all day
along the southern side of the bay, and it was close on
midnight before I got back to the city, feeling thoroughly
done up and very footsore. The last chime of twelve
o’clock sounded, as I swung wearily round 117th Street
into a narrow thoroughfare leading to the obscure
quarter of the town in which my finances forced me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
live. As I came within sight of the end house of a block
of low old-fashioned buildings, I received something of a
shock. I had passed by it that morning and had noticed
that it was to let. I was quite sure of this, because there
was something about the house that had especially
attracted my attention. I was struck with its utter
loneliness, its air of past grandeur—so oddly at variance
with the modern and mediocre buildings around it—and,
peeping in at the windows, I had taken stock of its big
oak-panelled apartments devoid of furniture and bestrewn
with dust and cobwebs.</p>

<p>Now, to my astonishment, I perceived a bright glow—a
kind of phosphorescent light—emanating from one of
the rooms on the ground floor. I approached nearer,
and, as I leaned against the verandah and peered in, it
suddenly seemed to me that the room was no longer
empty, but richly carpetted and full of ponderous, old-fashioned
furniture. I also seemed to see in the centre
of the room a long table covered with a snowy cloth, on
which were arranged, in rich profusion, many handsome
silver dishes containing a selection of the choicest food.
I was dumbfounded. Twelve hours ago there was not a
soul to be seen about the house nor a particle of furniture
in it, and now!—well, it looked to me as if it never, never
had been empty.</p>

<p>Whilst I was thus meditating, my face glued to the
window, I thought that a sudden blaze illuminated the
room, and by degrees I became conscious of the glare of
countless candles, some of the candelabra branching
from the walls, and others—of chased silver—standing
on the table. I then saw the door at the far end of the
apartment open, and a young and charming girl, dressed
à la mode de Marie Antoinette, her gown high-waisted
and her hair poudré, hurriedly enter. She gave a quick
glance at the table, and then, advancing to the fireplace,
where, for the first time, I perceived the cheery glow of a
huge log of wood, gazed at herself in a large, richly-framed
mirror. The reflection evidently pleased her, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
she turned round all smiles; and then her eyes fell on
the window, and on me.</p>

<p>In an instance her countenance changed. Putting a
finger to her lips with a great air of mystery, she beckoned
to me to come in. I started back in confusion. Again
she beckoned, and with such pretty pleading in her eyes
that, despite my travel-stained clothes, I yielded. I
walked to the front door; she opened it, and in hushed
tones, in which I detected a slight French accent, she
bade me welcome.</p>

<p>“We are having a fancy-dress dance,” she said, “but
none of the guests have as yet arrived, and I want you to
come into the ball-room while I rehearse some of the
dance music.”</p>

<p>She led the way across a big, deserted and strangely
silent hall, up a flight of thickly-carpeted stairs, along a
dimly lighted corridor, peopled with nothing but odd
shadows, to which I could see no material counterparts,
and into a room obviously prepared for a ball.</p>

<p>“There is no one about but you and I,” she said
laughingly. “Only we two; but someone else will arrive
soon. It’s not half-past twelve, is it?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said; “twenty past.”</p>

<p>“Ten more minutes!” She sighed deeply, and her
expression, which up to now had been one of gay mischief,
changed to one of immeasurable sadness. Then she
nodded, suddenly burst out laughing, and casting the
most bewitching look at me from out her long, thickly
lashed blue-grey eyes, sat down at the piano and began
to play a Strauss waltz.</p>

<p>Fascinated though I was by her extreme archness and
beauty, I could not stifle the thousand and one uncomfortable
thoughts that speedily crowded into my mind.</p>

<p>Who was this strangely friendly and peculiarly
solitary girl? Surely someone must have helped her
prepare the house and supper. Where were they?
Besides, she couldn’t possibly live in that house alone.</p>

<p>And yet, apart from the music—which seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
reverberate through every stick and stone of the building—there
was no other sound. I might have been alone
with her on some desert island in the far Pacific.</p>

<p>A feeling of intense but wholly unaccountable fear
gradually crept over me.</p>

<p>“It is close on the half hour,” she suddenly whispered.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and I heard a door from
somewhere in the lower part of the house open and shut.
Then came the sound of muffled footsteps, stealthily
feeling their way upstairs. Up and up they came, till
they arrived outside the door of the room we were in.
There they stopped, and I instinctively felt that their
owner was listening.</p>

<p>Presently the girl recommenced playing, and I saw the
door-handle began to turn. Slowly, very slowly, the door
then opened, and on the floor of the room there appeared
a black shadow—vague, indefinite and grotesque. The
girl looked over her shoulder at it, and I caught an
expression in her eyes that appalled me. Turning to the
piano again, she played frantically, and the faster her
fingers flew, the nearer crept that shadow.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to shoot right forward, there was a
wild scream of terror, a terrific crash, and all was in
absolute darkness.</p>

<p>I groped my way frantically towards the door. Something—I
could not define what—came into violent
collision with me; I staggered back half stunned; and,
when my brain cleared, I found myself standing in the
street, weak with exhaustion, and—hatless.</p>

<p>I visited the house the next day, when the sun was
shining brightly and there were plenty of people about.
It was as I had first seen it, untenanted and unfurnished.</p>

<p>I must then have dreamed the whole thing. And what
more likely! I was excessively tired at the time, so tired
that I felt I could hardly crawl home—and without a
doubt I had dropped off to sleep resting against the
verandah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, however, I determined to find out
if the interior of the house in any way resembled the
interior I had seen in my dream, and, with that object in
view, I applied to Mr. C.——, the owner, for permission
to look over it, frankly telling him why I was doing so. As
he appeared to be interested, I described my dream to
him in detail, and he afterwards told me the following
<span class="nobreak">story:—</span></p>

<p>“About fifty years ago, a very rich French family
occupied the house; and at the coming of age of their
daughter they gave a fancy-dress ball. Among the
guests was an Italian, who, being a rejected suitor of the
daughter’s, had not been invited. He appeared in some
grotesque and alarming costume, and when the dance
was at its height suddenly overturned a large oil lamp.</p>

<p>“In a moment the whole floor was ablaze; and before
anyone could stop him, he had seized the daughter of the
house and hurled her into the midst of the flaming mass.
Both he and the girl were burned to death, and the
house, although it was thoroughly restored, has never
let since.”</p>

<p>Having concluded his story, Mr. C.—— said he would
like to go with me to the house, and accordingly we set
out together.</p>

<p>Though my experience had been only a dream, the
coincidence connected with it, which only needed my
identification of the scene to be complete, was startling
enough, and I grew more and more excited as we neared
our destination. When we arrived, Mr. C.—— insisted
upon my going first; and once inside, recognising every
feature in the house, I led him first to the room in which
I had seen the supper-table laid, and then upstairs to the
ball-room, where, to my unspeakable surprise, lying in
the middle of the floor, I found my hat.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span></p>

<p>What a strangely fascinating city was old San
Francisco—that is to say, San Francisco before the last
great fire and earthquake! Consisting of street upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
street, terrace upon terrace of quaintly irregular buildings,
to me its atmosphere—as no other atmosphere ever
has been—was impregnated with the superphysical. I
stayed for a few days in a vast hotel in 117th Street, in
which I was the only visitor. I shrewdly suspect it was
haunted, although I cannot truthfully say that I ever
saw a ghost there, and when I retired to bed up flight
after flight of stairs, and past dimly-lighted passages
teeming with doors—doors with nothing, nothing
material at least, behind them—the only sounds I heard
were the hollow echoes of my own footsteps as I went on
ascending higher, higher, and higher.</p>

<p>Hearing, however, that I was interested in ghosts, the
landlord of the hotel introduced me one day to a Mr.
Sweeney, who kept a drug store in Market Street.</p>

<p>“The only experience I ever had with the Supernatural,”
Mr. Sweeney began, in answer to my interrogations,
“took place in this very room. Exactly twelve
years ago I engaged the services of a young man called
Edward Marsdon. He was very amiable and capable,
but highly-strung and hypernormally sensitive. He had
been with me about six months, when he came into the
parlour one evening with a face like a corpse. ‘I’ve
poisoned someone,’ he gasped. ‘Poisoned someone?’ I
ejaculated. ‘Good God, what do you mean?’ ‘What
I say,’ he replied. ‘A young fellow came into the store
about an hour ago and handed me a prescription. It was
signed by Dr. Knelligan, of 111th Street. I made it up,
as I thought, all right, and gave it him. A few minutes
ago, I found I had put in salts of lemon instead of
paregoric.’ ‘Are you sure?’ I asked. ‘Certain!’ he
said, ‘as the bottle of salts of lemon is on the table in the
laboratory with the stopper out. I must have used it in
mistake. The young man will die, if, indeed, he is not
dead already, and I am ruined for life.’ ‘We both are,’
I said tersely. ‘Ring up Dr. Knelligan at once, and ask
him for the young man’s address. When you get it,
drive round at once and see if you are in time.’ It was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
no use scolding him for carelessness—he was upset
enough already, and a ‘blowing up’ just then might, I
thought, result in another tragedy. The only thing to be
done was to hope for the best. He rang up Knelligan,
got the address, drove round to it, and discovered that
the young man had just left. The landlady had no idea
where he had gone. To Marsdon this was the last straw.
He came back in a state of utter collapse, trembling all
over as if he had ague, and, after telling me what happened,
he went upstairs and slammed his door. About a
quarter of an hour later, my wife, the servant, and I all
heard Marsdon, so we thought, come downstairs and go
out. The servant then went up to his room to make the
bed, and hearing her scream out, I ran upstairs, to find
her standing in the middle of the floor, wringing her
hands, whilst Marsdon was sitting in a chair—dead! He
had been dead some minutes. That, Mr. O’Donnell,
was the beginning of the strange occurrences here. If it
was not Marsdon whom we all heard go out, who could it
have been? There was no one in the house but we three,
and the body in the chair upstairs, so that it must have
been Marsdon’s ghost. Well, from that day on, we had
no peace.</p>

<p>“Footsteps, which we all recognised as Marsdon’s, for
he had a most peculiar lumping kind of walk, trod up and
down the stairs all hours of the day and night, and
frequently when I was in the laboratory mixing medicines
I was strongly conscious of some presence standing
close beside me and watching everything I did. One day
my wife saw him. She was going out, and wanting some
money, she called to me. As I did not answer, she went
in search of me, and finding me, as she thought, standing
on the hearthrug of the parlour with my back to her, she
touched me on the shoulder. The next moment she
discovered her mistake. The person whom she had mistaken
for me turned round, and she found herself confronted
with the white, scared countenance of Edward
Marsdon. She started back with a loud shriek, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Marsdon walked out of the room, and apparently right
through the servant who came running in to see what
was the matter. My wife asked the maid if she had seen
anything, and the latter said, ‘No, only a dark shadow
seemed to fall right across me, and just for a second or so
I felt miserably depressed.’ A week or so afterwards he
was again seen; this time by my wife and the maid.
They met him on the stairs. He appeared to be under
the influence of some very painful emotion, and he passed
them at a great rate, and so near that they felt his
clothes—apparently quite material—brush against them.
He disappeared in the laboratory, and on their entering
it immediately afterwards, there was no one there.
Something of this nature—either auditory or visual, or
both—now happened pretty well daily, until one morning
a young man came to the store to see me. ‘I am the
young man,’ he said, ‘to whom your assistant gave that
unfortunate mixture. I have just returned to San
Francisco, and have heard all about it. The medicine
was perfectly all right. I drank it directly I left here, and
it did me the world of good. There was not even the
suspicion of poison in it. Marsdon was labouring under
some extraordinary delusion. If only he had told my
landlady about it when he called and found I had gone,
she could have given him the glass I had drank out of,
which doubtless contained some dregs of the stuff—at
any rate, a sufficient quantity for analysis. I am told
there are rumours afloat that his apparition has been
seen several times since he died; not that I believe in
such things as ghosts.’</p>

<p>“‘Whether you believe in them or not,’ I said quietly,
‘it is a fact Edward Marsdon has both been seen and
heard.’ ‘Then I hope,’ he said, ‘my visit here to-day
will put matters all right, and that his poor, wandering
spirit, learning that I am alive and well, will find rest,
and trouble you no more.’ He then bid me good-morning
and walked towards the door. ‘My God!’ he suddenly
cried, coming to an abrupt halt, ‘there he is!’ I looked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and as sure as I am sitting here, Mr. O’Donnell, there
was Edward Marsdon, just as I had known him in life,
standing on the pavement with his face glued to the
window, peering in at us. The expression in his eyes was
one of infinite joy and astonishment.</p>

<p>“I took a step or two towards him with the intention
of speaking, when he immediately vanished, and from
that day to this the hauntings have entirely ceased.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subt">A HAUNTED OFFICE IN DENVER</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving San Francisco, I visited Sacramento,
where I bought a pair of braces, suspenders as they call
them there, that lasted me for years. They were the very
best half-dollar’s worth I ever had, and I still have the
remains of them stowed away in a big trunk amongst
other mementos of the long past.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine any city in America hotter than
Sacramento in the summer, or more unpleasantly cold in
the winter, apart from which there was nothing about
the place that caused it to be very deeply impressed on
my memory, saving that I met a man in one of the streets
one day who was so exactly like an old Clifton College
master called Tait that I believed it was he, and accosted
him accordingly.</p>

<p>The man gasped at me in amazement. “Why, Jupp,”
he said, “how on earth have you managed it. It’s only
ten minutes since I left you eating your dinner in the
Eagle Hotel on the other side of the town. Have you
wings?”</p>

<p>The moment he spoke I knew he was not Tait, but it
took me some time to convince him I was not Jupp; and
when he introduced me to the latter half an hour or so
later, I was not surprised, for I do not think there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
could have been a more striking likeness to myself, even
in my own portrait.</p>

<p>The coincidence was all the more remarkable since
there was at Clifton College, contemporary with Tait, a
master named Jupp, of whose cane I had the most
striking recollection. In appearance, however, the
Clifton Jupp was not in the least bit like me.</p>

<p>This was the only adventure of note, if one may so
designate it, I had during this visit to Sacramento. I
went on from there to Denver, where I met one or two
relatives of friends of mine in England, and did a little
work as a “Free Lance” journalist. It was summer
when I had last stayed in Denver, and then the intense
heat, combined with an injudicious consumption of fruit
and iced water, had brought on a mild attack of cholera,
which left me with a none too favourable impression of
the place.</p>

<p>But now all was changed. The weather was much
cooler; I was growing acclimatised, and I did not feel
altogether among strangers. Consequently my apathy
vanished, and, despite the fact that my employment
was anything but lucrative, I enjoyed this second stay
in Denver immensely.</p>

<p>The town had not been built long. Indeed, ten years
previously it had only one anything like orthodox
street; so that it was the last place in the world where
one would expect to come across a haunted house. Yet
I heard of three haunted houses at least whilst I was
there.</p>

<p>The one I think most likely to interest my readers I
heard of in this way. I had been to the Zoological
Gardens, and was returning by tram, when a journalist
called Rouillac, with whom I had a very slight acquaintance,
came running up to me in a great state of excitement.
“O’Donnell,” he cried, “I have unearthed something
that will interest you—the case of a haunting in an
office in Race Street.” He then proceeded to give me
an account of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The office was rented by a Mrs. Bell, a typist who
employed two girls, Stella Dean and Hester Holt.</p>

<p>One day Hester Holt failed to put in an appearance.</p>

<p>“If she is ill,” Mrs. Bell said to Stella Dean, “she
ought to have let me know. There was nothing wrong
with her yesterday, was there?”</p>

<p>“Not that I am aware of,” Stella Dean replied.
“When she parted from me, just across the way, she
went off in the best of spirits. I expect she’ll turn up
all right to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The morrow came, and Hester Holt not arriving, Stella
Dean was despatched in the dinner-hour to find out what
had become of her. She returned looking very white
and scared.</p>

<p>“Why, Stella,” Mrs. Bell exclaimed. “What on
earth’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Hester’s gone away without telling anyone where she
was going,” Stella Dean answered.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so,” Mrs. Bell cried. “What can
have happened?”</p>

<p>“She never went to her lodgings after leaving here;
at least, that’s what the landlady says,” Stella Dean
replied. “And she hasn’t written, either—but I think
you’d better call there yourself; I don’t like the woman.”
And Stella burst out crying.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the mystery. Mrs. Bell
interviewed the landlady, who stuck to her statement
that she had neither seen Hester Holt nor heard of her
since she had left the house two days ago, presumably to
attend business. There had been no words between them,
she said, and Hester had seemed as usual, perfectly
happy. She was a singularly reserved girl, and never
mentioned her family excepting when she went away for
her annual holiday. She then requested that all her
letters should be forwarded to the address of her married
sister.</p>

<p>The landlady, Mrs. Britton, gave this address to Mrs.
Bell, and the latter, writing off at once, received an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
answer by return of post to say that Hester was not
there and no tidings of her had been received for over a
month. The married sister, however, made an important
statement. She said that one person was sure to know of
Hester’s whereabouts, and that was Pete Simpkins, the
young man with whom she kept company, and was
hoping eventually to marry. Mrs. Bell, now keenly
interested, hastened off and interviewed Simpkins. To
quote her own words, he seemed “a bright, intelligent
young man,” and exhibited unfeigned astonishment and
perturbation on learning of the disappearance of his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>“When did you last see her?” Mrs. Bell enquired.</p>

<p>“The day she left you,” he responded. “I had been
out in the country all day, superintending the building of
a large farm some ten miles to the east of this city, and I
was cycling home along a very unfrequented route, when
I met a buggy. Two girls were in it, and to my amazement,
they were Hester and Stella Dean.”</p>

<p>“What!” Mrs. Bell cried. “Stella Dean? Are you
sure?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely!” Simpkins replied. “I can swear to it.
It astonished me because I knew they had been on very
bad terms. I was engaged to Stella before I met Hester,
but I could not stand her temper. One day she was so
enraged with my dog because it snarled at her, that she
seized my walking-stick and beat it on the head till it
was dead. I found her standing over it, white with fury;
and feeling that after what I had witnessed I could never
like her again, I broke off our engagement there and then.
After that I met Hester Holt at the same house where I
had first seen Stella, and we at once became friends.
Stella Dean did not like it, but she took on more than
was necessary; and Hester told me there had been several
very painful scenes between them. Indeed, I understood
that out of business hours they were not on speaking
terms; hence you can judge of my astonishment when
I saw them driving in the buggy side by side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all very mysterious,” Mrs. Bell observed. “If
she does not turn up soon, I shall have to inform the
police.”</p>

<p>The following day, Mrs. Bell asked Stella if she had
gone for a drive with Hester Holt the evening of the
latter’s disappearance, and Stella Dean promptly replied,
“No; the last time I saw Hester was when she left here
that afternoon. She said good-bye to me as usual on the
other side of the road, and I have never set eyes on her
since.”</p>

<p>She admitted she had once been engaged to Pete
Simpkins, but emphatically denied that Hester’s keeping
company with him had led to any rupture between them.
“Hester and I were always on the very best of terms,”
she said, “and it would be downright mean of anyone to
allege otherwise. Besides, I can produce proofs to the
contrary.”</p>

<p>The next day, as Hester was still missing, Mrs. Bell
told the police. The affair was at once inquired into, and
Pete Simpkins’ story about the buggy was corroborated.
Someone else had seen the two girls driving towards the
outskirts of the town that same evening; whilst a car
proprietor also came forward and declared that he
recollected Miss Holt hiring a buggy from him, but that
she had driven off in it alone. When the buggy was
brought back, he being out, his wife had taken the money
for it. But as it was then dusk, she could not possibly
swear to the identity of the lady who had paid her,
especially as the latter had been so muffled up, presumably
on account of the coldness of the night, that
practically nothing of her face was visible. She could
only say Miss Dean resembled her both in build and
height.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill2"></a>
<img src="images/ill2.jpg" width="384" height="622" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>“Who is that tall, good-looking girl, Stella, that I’ve seen
following you into the building...?”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Stella Dean was now asked if she could produce an
alibi; and, accordingly, her mother, a very decrepit old
lady, declared that Stella had come straight home from
the office, and had remained indoors all that evening.
To add to the complexity of the affair, someone else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
testified to having seen Hester Holt enter Mrs. Britton’s
house with a latch key rather late on the night in question;
and this of course made some people suspect Mrs.
Britton, but the police could prove nothing, and the
matter was eventually dropped.</p>

<p>All this happened about three months before I arrived
in Denver.</p>

<p>A week after the disappearance of Hester Holt, Mrs.
Bell had a new assistant called Vera Cummings, a very
material, practical young lady, the daughter of a farmer
somewhere near Omaha.</p>

<p>The day after her arrival, Miss Cummings was busy
typewriting in the office with Mrs. Bell and Stella Dean,
when she suddenly exclaimed, “How is it that I get
convulsed with shivers whenever I sit next to you, Miss
Dean? I don’t when I’m sitting next to Mrs. Bell. Eugh!
I feel as if the icy east wind were blowing right through
me.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” Stella Dean replied; “you
imagine it.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” Miss Cummings retorted; “I’m going
to sit somewhere else,” and she moved to the other side
of the table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell made no comment. An hour or so afterwards,
Vera Cummings abruptly observed:</p>

<p>“My, Stella Dean, what long legs you have!”</p>

<p>“What in the world do you mean?” was the surprised
and rather indignant retort.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s no one else on your side of the table,
is there?” Vera Cummings responded; “and someone’s
feet keep kicking mine.”</p>

<p>“You’re dreaming,” Stella Dean said, and Mrs. Bell
noticed she turned very pale.</p>

<p>Two days now passed uneventfully, but on the third
day after the above conversation, Mrs. Bell and the two
girls were sitting talking—it was close on the interval for
tea, and work was just then very slack—when Vera
Cummings remarked, “Who is that tall, good-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
girl, Stella, that I’ve seen following you into the building
on several occasions. I’ve watched her keeping close
behind you till you get to the elevator, and then she
disappears. Where she goes I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“A tall, good-looking girl following me to the elevator,”
Stella Dean repeated, her cheeks ashy. “What do
you mean? I’ve seen no one. You’ve dreamt it.”</p>

<p>“What was she like?” Mrs. Bell interrupted.</p>

<p>Vera Cummings gave a minute description of her.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Stella, we don’t know anyone like
her?” Mrs. Bell said quietly. “That description seems
to tally exactly with someone we once knew. Someone
who used to frequent this place. Can she have returned,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who you mean,” Stella Dean said
crossly. “I tell you, I’ve seen no one.”</p>

<p>The next morning they all three arrived simultaneously,
and went up together in the elevator. On
nearing the office, the sound of a typewriter was heard.
They looked at one another in open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p>“It must be one of the other clerks in the building,”
Vera Cummings said. “She’s mistaken our room for
hers. She’s an early bird, anyway, for I reckon there’s
no one else arrived yet.”</p>

<p>“But the door’s locked,” Mrs. Bell whispered. “See,
here’s the key!” And she took it out of her pocket as
she spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no mistaking the sound, is there?”
Vera Cummings laughed. “Click, click, click—that’s a
typewriter, sure enough. Someone must have got in
through the window. My, Stella, how white you are!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell glanced sharply at Stella Dean—there was
not an atom of colour in her cheeks, and the pupils of
her eyes were dilating with terror.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell then put the key in the lock and opened the
door. The typewriter was working away furiously, but
there was no one at it, the room was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
empty. It stopped the moment Mrs. Bell crossed the
threshold.</p>

<p>That afternoon Stella Dean complained of a headache
and went home early. She was in bed for several weeks,
and during her absence from the office the strange
phenomena there entirely ceased. The morning she
returned, Pete Simpkins met her and Vera Cummings
just outside the office building. He was bubbling over
with excitement.</p>

<p>“She’s come back!” he cried. “Come back, and
never sent me a word. I <em>am</em> glad though.... Hoorah!”</p>

<p>“Come back!” Stella Dean said, drawing herself up
stiffly and regarding him with an angry stare. “Who
are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Hester Holt!” Pete Simpkins ejaculated. “She’s
just gone into your place. Didn’t you know?”</p>

<p>Miss Dean made no reply. She simply pushed past
him and walked in. Vera Cummings, however, dawdled
behind.</p>

<p>“What’s Miss Holt like?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Simpkins described her.</p>

<p>“Why that’s the girl I used constantly to see following
Stella,” she said. “Where she disappears to is a mystery,
but it’s only one of the many funny things that have
happened since I’ve been here.”</p>

<p>She then told him about the typewriter and the feet
under the table. Pete Simpkins repeated the story to
his friends. Rouillac got hold of it, and hence, as the
reader already knows, it was handed on to me.</p>

<p>Rouillac was most anxious that I should go with him
to the haunted office straightaway, but it so happened
that I had work to finish in a given time, and it was
therefore arranged that he should call for me one day
the following week.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed, he came. “I fear it’s no use,”
he said; “the office is closed, and it is impossible to get
permission to go there. It’s come about like this. The
day after Stella Dean returned to work, Mrs. Bell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
away—ill—and the two girls were alone. Some time after
they had started work, it might have been eleven o’clock
or thereabouts, Vera Cummings got up to get a drink of
water, and in passing chanced to look at Stella Dean.
The latter was leaning forward in her chair and staring
with an expression of the utmost horror in her eyes at a
despatch case on the floor, which was oscillating violently
to and fro. Vera noticed that the despatch case was
marked on one side with the letters ‘H.&nbsp;H.’ ‘That’s
odd,’ she cried. ‘What makes it do like that—it can’t
be due to vibration, because there’s nothing going by
outside. How do you account for it, Stella?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ Stella Dean gasped, making a
vigorous attempt to appear unconcerned; ‘perhaps
they’re shunting something heavy downstairs.’</p>

<p>“‘But we should hear them,’ Vera Cummings replied.
‘I believe it’s Hester Holt; she’s dead, and for some
mysterious reason her spirit haunts this room.’</p>

<p>“‘Nonsense,’ Stella Dean stammered. ‘How can you
be so silly! There are no such things as ghosts.’</p>

<p>“After a while, the case stopped shaking, and the two
girls went on with their work. Lunch time came and
they both rose to get ready to go out. Vera Cummings
had put on her hat, and was walking to the door, when
she heard a sharp cry. She turned round, and there was
Stella Dean standing in front of the looking glass and
gazing at the reflection of a pale face, with two dark
menacing eyes glaring fixedly at her from over her
shoulder. Vera recognised the face at once. It was that
of the girl she had so often seen following Stella, the girl
Pete Simpkins had told her was Hester Holt.</p>

<p>“She was so frightened, for she knew for certain now
that the thing she was looking at was nothing earthly,
that she ran out of the room, and as she crossed the
threshold, the door slammed behind her with a terrific
crash. Ashamed of her cowardice, she tried the door-handle.
It turned, but though she pressed her hardest,
the door would not open. She called to Stella, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was no reply. Greatly alarmed, she ran to the elevator
and fetched the man in charge of it. They both pushed
the door, and still it would not open. They were
deliberating what to do, when they saw the handle
suddenly turn and the door gently swing back on its
hinges. They peered in. Stella Dean was lying on the
hearthrug in a dead faint. She died that same night.”</p>

<p>“Died!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Some people fancy she committed suicide, but
her mother declares that her heart had long been affected
and that she died from syncope. Anyhow, she’s dead,
and the office is closed, as nothing will persuade Vera
Cummings to work there till Mrs. Bell is well enough to
return. I tried to get permission to spend a night there,
but Mrs. Bell dare not give it. She says the landlord is
furious with her for allowing the report to get abroad
that the building is haunted, and threatens her with a
libel action if he hears anything further.”</p>

<p>“That’s a great pity,” I said; “for few cases have
interested me more.”</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” Rouillac asked.</p>

<p>“Why,” I replied, “the same as you. There can only
be one conclusion. Stella Dean was madly jealous of
Hester Holt, and during that drive in the buggy she
killed her. Whether the murder was premeditated or
done in a sudden fit of blind passion—you tell me her
temper at times was very uncontrollable—of course we
cannot say. From your sketch of her, however, I am
inclined to think she planned the whole thing.”</p>

<p>“But what could she have done with the body?”
Rouillac said. “The police searched everywhere.”</p>

<p>“So they say,” I observed; “but the track Simpkins
was on when he passed the buggy affords countless
opportunities for concealing a body. It is full of deep
ditches, creeks, and crevices, covered with a thick and
rank vegetation, and the police would take at least a
century to explore it. Besides, from what I know
of the super-physical I do not think for one moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that Stella Dean was haunted without some poignant
reason.”</p>

<p>“Was haunted!” Rouillac observed.</p>

<p>“You said she was dead, didn’t you?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rouillac replied slowly, “there’s no doubt
whatever on that point. She’s dead right enough. But
when Vera Cummings passed by the office this morning,
she saw Stella Dean enter it—Stella Dean just as she
looked when alive, only very white and in abject terror.
She passed right in through the half-open doorway, and,
as usual, Hester Holt followed her.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="subt">CASES OF HAUNTINGS IN ST. LOUIS, NEW YORK, AND
CHICAGO</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most extraordinary men I have ever met was
Ephraim B. Vandergooch, who, at the time of my travels
in America, practised dentistry in 6th Street, St. Louis.
Dentists are not, as a rule, the people to associate themselves
with psychical research, and it is just as well for
their patients, perhaps, that they are not, for sitting up
all night in dark houses looking for ghosts has an unsteadying
effect on the nerves—it is apt to make one
“jumpy”—and if a dentist’s hand were to jump, it is
more than likely that his patient would jump too. Mr.
Vandergooch, however, was an exception. He was a
ghost hunter, and his investigations had but a slight and
temporary effect on his nervous system. His hand was as
steady as a rock, his wrists like steel. I went to him to
have a tooth filled, and during the operation I asked him
if he knew of any haunted houses in the town.</p>

<p>He was a stranger to me then, and of course I expected
a superior smile, if not an actual sneer, for, as I have said,
dentists are, as a rule, anything but psychics. To my
surprise, however, he took me quite seriously, and said he
knew of several haunted places in St. Louis, and that
nothing interested him more than really first-hand ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
stories. He told me he had had an experience himself,
and narrated the <span class="nobreak">following:—</span></p>

<p>“A few years ago,” he began, “I learned of a haunting
in a street of rather older houses than these, close to here;
and as the evidence in this case was to a large extent
corroborative, I decided to investigate it. It was
Christmas time, and the thought of earthbound spirits
pacing up and down cold, empty houses, when all around
was warmth and jollity, depressed me. I felt that I must,
now that an opportunity had come, try to see them, and
if possible do something for them.</p>

<p>“I set out on Christmas Eve, and I admit that when I
left the cheerfully lighted thoroughfare, and plunged into
the dark silent emptiness of the house, my heart almost
failed me. Apart from ghosts there were so many possibilities,
and what more likely than that some tramp or
criminal had forced an entrance, and was hiding somewhere
on the premises. For a few seconds I stood and
listened, and then, feeling a trifle more assured, I closed
the door gently and advanced cautiously along the wide
hall. At each step I took I became more and more
sensitive to an atmosphere of intense sadness and
desolation—an atmosphere of intense loneliness, loneliness
that is without hope—that is perpetual and absolute.
It could be felt in all parts of the house, but more particularly,
perhaps, in the kitchen, which was built out at
the back on the ground floor. I had never been in such a
dreary and inhospitable kitchen. The night was bitterly
cold and the bare stones sent chilly currents up my legs
and back, into my very brain.</p>

<p>“To remain in such a hole till morning was assuredly
courting pneumonia or rheumatic fever. I looked at the
range, it was covered with rust and verdigris. If only it
could be lighted! Then I uttered an exclamation of joy,
for lying in one corner was a pile of wood—boxes, shelves,
faggots, etc., intermingled with an assortment of
other rubbish. In my early days I had lived on a ranch
out west, and the experience I had had there now came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
useful. In a few minutes there was a loud crackling, and
the kitchen filled with a ruddy glow. A couple of dresser-drawers
served me for a seat, and I was soon ensconced in
a tolerably snug position, from which, however, I was
prepared to spring at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>“The hours sped by, and the silence deepened.</p>

<p>“At last, just about two o’clock, when I was beginning
to think nothing would happen, I heard a door slam
somewhere upstairs. This was followed by a series of
creaks, and I heard someone cautiously descending the
stairs. A great fear now seized me, and had I been able,
I should doubtless have beaten a hasty retreat. Instead,
I was possessed with a kind of paralysis, which rendered
me quite helpless and prevented me from either moving a
limb or uttering a sound. The creaks came nearer—down,
down, down, until quite suddenly they stopped,
and I heard a cough.</p>

<p>“It was repeated—cough, cough, cough. The cough
of a delicate, neurotic woman. At first it simply startled
me—it sounded so distinct, so reverberating, so real.
Then it irritated me, and then it infuriated me—almost
drove me mad. ‘God take the woman,’ I raved. ‘Will
she never cease.’</p>

<p>“Cough, cough, cough. A nervous, hacking cough, a
worrying, grating cough, an intensely silly, murder-instilling
cough. I could see the owner of it—upstairs,
hidden from me by impenetrable darkness, and yet quite
distinct—a slight, pale, excessively plain little woman,
with watery eyes and a quivering mouth. Heavens, how
the mouth maddened me! On she went—cough, cough,
cough! She was still coughing, when I suddenly became
aware of a presence close beside me, and I saw in the glow
from the dying embers the figure of a man seated at a
table in the middle of the kitchen. He appeared to be
trying to write, but to be unable to collect his thoughts.
Every now and then he paused, dashed his pen down,
and clenched his fists furiously. At first I could not
understand his behaviour, and then it all of a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
occurred to me—the coughing, of course. That perpetual
noise, that everlasting hacking—it distracted, demented
him. I watched him with feelings of infinite sympathy.
At last, unable to stand it any longer, he sprang from
his seat and dashed upstairs.</p>

<p>“I heard him race up two steps at a time. No madman
would have raced faster or more nimbly. Then came a
strange variety of sounds—a gratuitous course in
phonetics—an altercation, more coughing, oaths, bumping,
a scream, a thud, a little feeble cough, silence, and
then rapidly descending footsteps—a man’s footsteps.
I did not wait for them. The spell that had hitherto held
me limb-tied now abruptly left me, and I fled out of the
building—home.</p>

<p>“The next day—Christmas Day—I made my report
to the owner of the house, and told her exactly what had
happened.</p>

<p>“‘Good heavens!’ she exclaimed, ‘and he’s married
Maisie! Swear that you will never tell a soul, no one, not
even your most intimate friend, and I will give you an
explanation of what you witnessed.’ (“All this
happened years ago,” Mr. Vandergooch remarked, “so
it’s all right my telling you now.”) I promised, and
she at once began.</p>

<p>“‘Ten years ago the occupants of the house you’ve
been in were a well-known dramatist and his wife, whom
I will call Mr. and Mrs. Charles Turner. Mrs. Turner
was exactly like the woman you imagined—frail, small
and very plain; whilst her husband would tally with the
man you saw in the kitchen—a tall, muscular, handsome
man. He obviously married her for her money, poor
soul, for there was nothing in her to attract him, and
everyone could see how she irritated him, especially
when she coughed—in fact, he often said to me, ‘You
don’t know, Mrs. Wehlen, how Eva annoys me. Whenever
I am in the midst of my work, trying to concentrate
my thoughts, she starts her infernal coughing—I can
hear her all over the house—hack, hack, hack.’ ‘She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
can’t help it, poor thing,’ I replied. ‘You ought to feel
sorry for her.’ ‘Feel sorry for her,’ he said. ‘You’d feel
sorry for her if you were tormented as I am. I believe
she does it on purpose.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, one evening—to be precise, it was Christmas
Eve—Mrs. Turner was found at the foot of the hall
staircase with her neck broken. There was no direct
evidence as to how she came there, but as one of the
stair-rods was found loose, it was presumed that she fell
over it, and, accordingly, a verdict of accidental death
was returned. Charles Turner left the house directly
afterwards, and a few months ago married my niece,
Maisie. As far as I know, what you have seen has never
been seen by anyone else, but coughing in the house has
been heard, and it is quite plain to me now that Charles
Turner murdered his first wife. I only pray to Heaven
he won’t serve Maisie the same.’</p>

<p>“But he did,” Mr. Vandergooch added, “for she, too,
was found at the foot of the staircase with her neck
broken! In all probability she had possessed some
idiosyncrasy that worried and annoyed him; or, possibly
having once taken to murder, he felt he must go on with
it—the habit of homicide being, no doubt, just as
fascinating as the habit of drugs or of drink.</p>

<p>“Nothing, however, was proven, and, for all I know
to the contrary, he may still be alive, still be killing
people to appease his hyper-sensitive and outraged
nerves.”</p>

<p>This experience of Mr. Vandergooch made me think;
and eventually led to my devoting no small amount of
attention to psychology and criminology. From what a
variety of influences, it seemed to me, any one act might
be induced, and to what innumerable and varied causes
any one crime, for instance murder, might be traced. A
minute bone pressing on a certain section of the brain, a
stomach continually overladen with beefsteak and other
animal food, over-excited nerves, the sight of some
locality, such as a wood, an object, such as a knife, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
may lead to the same thing—the desire to kill; whilst,
at the same time, the superphysical, through the agency
of some evil spirit continually whispering to its selected
victim the arrestive, the compelling thought, almost
enforces any and every sort of crime. Seeing, then, that
in every act of cruelty or violence it is more than likely
that either one or other of these factors has been at
work, is it fair that we should so readily condemn and
therewith rest content?</p>

<p>True, it may be, and, I believe, it is expedient to
punish the criminal, but surely it is even more urgent
that we should make ourselves thoroughly acquainted
with his case, so that we may if possible discover the
factor that conduces to his crime, and then either destroy
or counteract it.</p>

<p>From St. Louis I went to New York, where I lodged in
a fifty cent. hotel in West Quay.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly elevating neighbourhood, but
it was one that boasted of several haunted houses. I
was taken to see one of them—a small store that supplied
seamen’s kits—by a fellow lodger, who, if I remember
rightly, bore the name of Boxer. The proprietor of the
store was a Swede; his name I cannot quite recall, it
was, I believe, Jansen, or something like Jansen. He
was at first extremely reticent, but on my assuring him
that I was not in touch with any of the New York
journals, and would not connive at his story getting into
print, he agreed to tell me what had happened.</p>

<p>Calling his wife, a plain, stolid-looking woman, dressed
in a neat and spotlessly clean print gown, he led the way
upstairs to the top landing. There he stopped opposite a
closed door, in front of which stood a large oak chest.
“That’s the room,” he said; “we’ve barricaded it like
that to prevent the children going in. When we first
came here, my wife, and I, and our youngest child,
Bertha, slept there. But we none of us liked the room,
and we soon began to have very disturbed nights. I had
ghastly nightmares, and so had my wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“And Bertha too,” Mrs. Jansen chimed in; “she
used to dread being left alone in the room even for five
minutes, and used to cry till one or other of us went to
her.”</p>

<p>“That’s right enough,” Mr. Jansen interrupted; “and
Bertha’s never behaved like that since we moved her
into another room.”</p>

<p>“Well, we experienced nothing more disturbing than
bad dreams for the first fortnight or so, and nothing
happened until we were both aroused one night by
hearing Bertha scream. We lit a candle and got out of
bed. ‘What is the matter,’ I asked; ‘are you in
pain?’ ‘No, Poppa,’ she said. ‘Not in pain, but so
frightened. I kept hearing the bed creak, and I thought
one of you was coming out of it to kill me.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, what nonsense,’ I said. ‘You’ve been
dreaming again, child.’ Then, turning to my wife, I
remarked, ‘If she has many more of these nightmares we
had better send for the doctor. Don’t you think so?’
My wife made no answer, but suddenly gave a cry and
pointed at the bed. ‘Otto!’ she cried. ‘Look at the
clothes! We never left them like that. What’s happened
to them?’ I looked. The clothes were all heaped together
down the centre of the bed exactly in the shape of
a human body, with the face turned towards us.</p>

<p>“We all three stared at it in open-mouthed silence,
and the longer we gazed, the more pronounced grew the
features, until they at last became so lifelike, so evil,
that my wife and I instinctively shrank back against the
child’s cot, and tried to hide the thing from her. My wife
declares she saw it move.”</p>

<p>“It did,” Mrs. Jansen said. “I saw it distinctly shift
nearer to us. So did Bertha.”</p>

<p>“I know you were both agreed on that point,” Mr.
Jansen went on. “All I can say is I didn’t see it do
that, but I started praying, and whether it was the effect
of my prayers or not, the clothes gradually became
clothes again, and, after soothing Bertha, we scrambled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
back into bed, feeling rather ashamed we had been so
frightened.</p>

<p>“The following evening after Bertha had been put to
bed, we heard her scream again, and we ran up and
found her quivering under the bedclothes. She said our
bed had begun rattling, just as if we were moving in it.
On turning to examine it, we found the clothes just as
we had seen them in the night, with one of the pillows
pressed and moulded into the speaking likeness of a face.</p>

<p>“As I looked at it, the features became convulsed with
such an indescribable expression of hellishness that I
backed against the table and upset the light.</p>

<p>“On re-lighting it, the thing on the bed had disappeared,
and the clothes were once again normal. That
same night, some time after we were in bed, I awoke to
find myself being roughly shaken by the shoulders. It
was my wife, but, perhaps I had better let her go on with
the story.”</p>

<p>“I shook him,” Mrs. Jansen explained, “because a
feeling had suddenly come over me that I must kill
Bertha. The very first night we slept in the room I
became obsessed with a passionate desire to see someone
die, a desire that I can assure you was absolutely novel
to me, because I flatter myself I am naturally kind-hearted
and extremely sensitive to seeing other people
suffer.”</p>

<p>“She’s kindness itself,” Mr. Jansen observed.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Jansen went on, “the feeling became so
unbearable, that fearing I should actually be compelled
to kill someone, I awoke my husband and begged him to
tie my hands together; which, after some hesitation, he
did. Bertha was crying bitterly, and told us she had
again heard creaks in the room, just as if someone was
getting out of bed to murder her. That was the last
time we slept in the room. I felt it was a positive danger
to spend another night in it, and so we removed into the
one we are sleeping in now.”</p>

<p>“And has it never been occupied since?” I asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, for one night,” Mrs. Jansen replied. “A niece
of mine, Charlotte, came to stay with us, and as we had
nowhere else to put her, she had to sleep there. We went
to bed rather late that night, and I dreamed three times
in succession that Charlotte was creeping down the stairs
with some strange weapon in her hand, with which she
intended killing Bertha. Bertha was then sleeping alone
in the room facing ours.</p>

<p>“The third dream was so vivid that I awoke from it
bathed with perspiration. I told my husband, and he
said, ‘Well, that’s curious, for I thought I heard someone
moving about overhead. I’ll go and see if anything is
amiss.’ He opened the door, and, going on to the
landing, discovered Charlotte tiptoeing cautiously down
the stairs, holding a long, glittering pair of scissors in her
hand, and with an expression on her face similar to that
on the face in the bedclothes. ‘What are you doing
here?’ my husband demanded, and Charlotte at once
dropped the scissors and began crying. She told us that
no sooner had she got into bed, than she felt like another
person. It was just as if someone else’s soul had crept
into her body. All her old sentiments and ideals
vanished, and the maddest and most unholy ideas
presented themselves in rapid succession to her mind. A
blind hatred of everyone in the house possessed her, and
she was seized with the most ungovernable craving to
kill. For a long time she fought against this mania, until
at last, unable to restrain it any longer, she got out of bed
and sought some weapon. Cold hands, she declared,
seemed to guide her to the scissors, and armed with them,
she crept downstairs, just as I had seen her in my sleep,
determined to butcher Bertha first, and then, if possible,
my husband and myself.</p>

<p>“She pleaded our forgiveness and begged to be
allowed to go home first thing in the morning. ‘I do not
feel I am responsible for my behaviour,’ she said. ‘I
never had the slightest inclination to do anything of the
sort before. I am sure it’s that room. There’s some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sinister influence in it, and if I go back to it, I’m certain
I shall do something dreadful.’</p>

<p>“She spent the rest of the night on the sofa in the
parlour, and shortly before noon returned to her parents.</p>

<p>“After that we locked up the room and had this chest
placed against the door, as you now see it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the history of the house?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Only that before we came here,” Mrs. Jansen said,
“there were several sudden deaths. I do not think any
of them were actually attributed to murder, though they
were all due to rather extraordinary accidents. Originally,
I believe, the house was an inn, kept by a woman
who bore a very evil reputation, and we have always
wondered if the hauntings had anything to do with her.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you couldn’t tell whether the face formed
by the bedclothes was a man or a woman’s?” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Not, perhaps, by the actual features,” she responded,
“only by the expression. I can’t explain how, but it
was an expression which at once explained to me its sex,
and that sex was not masculine.”</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>As I have said, this was not the only case of haunting
in West Quay that I heard of during this visit of mine to
New York, but it is the only one of sufficient interest
to note here. Two equally interesting cases, perhaps,
came my way when I was travelling West. The one was
in Boston, the other in Chicago. I will deal with the
Chicago one <span class="nobreak">first:—</span></p>

<p>A banker in Chicago, to whom I had a letter of introduction,
hearing that I was interested in ghosts, showed
me a house close to Michigan Avenue where he had had
a somewhat novel experience.</p>

<p>“Some years ago,” he said, “that house had the
reputation for being very badly haunted, and not by one
ghost, but by dozens. It was then occupied by an eccentric
old millionaire, whom I will call Mr. Hoonigan. Mr.
Hoonigan had a very curious hobby. In a room, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
named Duckdom, he had a collection of the most exquisitely
wrought models of women, clad in costumes
which must surely have cost thousands of pounds. They
were all made in Paris, and many of them had once stood
in windows in the Rue de Rivoli. I have never seen anything
to equal them; their eyes, hair, and finger nails
were not only beautifully coloured and moulded, they
were most natural and life-like. Mr. Hoonigan worshipped
them. He used to spend hours a day sitting
before each of them in turn, fondling their hands and
making love to them in the most exaggerated fashion.
Mad! Yes, of course, he was mad; but his madness did
not always take such a harmless form. In a room
opposite Duckdom, which he named Devildom, he had
collected the models—some fifty or more—of murderers,
and other criminals of the lowest type, besides a heterogeneous
assortment of the most revolting objects.
Amongst these objects were images of the South Sea
Islands and Mexican gods; figures in wood and stone,
representing ghosts and demons; cases full of mummies
and skeletons; weapons that had once belonged to
murderers and still bore traces of their victims’ blood;
scalping and flaying knives; and a variety of ancient
instruments of torture; whilst to accentuate the horror
of the room as a whole, paintings such as only a brain in
the most advanced stage of morbid disease could have
conceived covered the walls. Mr. Hoonigan did not
make a practice of showing his collections promiscuously,
he was far too jealous of them, and I do not suppose there
were ten people in Chicago who knew of their existence.
Indeed, it was only with the very greatest difficulty that
I got his permission to view them. He allowed no
servants to sleep in the house, and when I went there one
evening to see his treasures, he opened the door to me
himself. ‘Do you see this?’ he cackled, pointing to the
brown muzzle of a revolver, which showed itself from
under his coat. ‘Well, I have two more of them, and the
house is full of pitfalls, all admirable inventions of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
own, and warranted to upset the calculations of even the
most experienced cracksman.’ ‘Have you ever been
troubled by burglars?’ I asked, glancing over the
shoulders of the queer old figure before me, and letting
my eyes wander round the great hall, dimly lighted and
full of many suggestive nooks. ‘Yes, several times,’ he
said, ‘and once, one actually got in. He is here now.’
‘Here now!’ I cried. ‘Why, you surely don’t mean to
say that you’ve reformed him and kept him as your
servant?’</p>

<p>“Mr. Hoonigan chuckled, and his yellow fangs reminded
me unpleasantly of the blunt and rusty teeth of a
saw. ‘Not exactly,’ he said. ‘He fell into one of my
traps. You will see him later in my little chamber of
horrors. He’s been there ever since.’ (This seemed a
trifle indiscreet; but Mr. Hoonigan knew he could trust
me. You see, I was his banker, and business means
business in Chicago.)</p>

<p>“‘But come,’ he continued, ‘I will show you Duckdom
first, because you will then the better appreciate its
opposite. There is nothing like contrasts to teach you
true enjoyment.’ He stepped into an elevator, and we
went up, passing storey after storey, all dark, silent and
deserted. At last we stopped, and getting out, entered a
brilliantly illuminated room. ‘Here they are!’ Mr.
Hoonigan exclaimed. ‘Let me introduce you to my fair
women friends.’ I looked round, and there before me
was a vast assemblage of women, all of them richly
dressed in the very latest fashion. All beautiful, however,
and all most artistically posed; some sitting, some
standing, some lying at full length on rugs and sofas.
They were so absolutely natural that it took me some
seconds to realise they were only models—models in
wax. Mr. Hoonigan approached one, and taking its
hand, pressed it reverently. ‘When I die,’ he said, ‘I
shall be placed here, and the room shall be hermetically
sealed. I want no other heaven.’ He then took me
across the landing to another room. I had been prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for a shock, but not for the kind of shock I got when the
door opened, and a hell, seething with devilry—ten
thousand times more devilish than the devilry of Dante’s
Hell—was suddenly thrust under my very nose. I
recoiled, and Mr. Hoonigan, perceiving my fright, playfully
pushed me in. When we were well in the midst of
them, he pointed with great glee to several of the most
notorious murderers, and insisted upon my picking up
and examining their weapons. He then made me sit on a
garotting chair, which he had quite recently purchased in
Cuba, and when I was thus seated, he thrust a skull on
my knee, which he said was that of a Red Indian Chief,
who had for certain skinned alive with his own hands a
whole family of whites.</p>

<p>“By this time, as you may think, I had had enough of
it, but, as Mr. Hoonigan truly remarked, there was so
much to be seen; besides, he must, he said, whilst I was
there, show me a stock of engravings which he had just
bought in Madrid. They dated from the reign of Philip
II., and represented, in grim detail, all the horrors of the
Spanish Inquisition. But this was not all. Their chief
interest, according to Mr. Hoonigan, lay in the fact that
the inquisitors—to quote Mr. Hoonigan’s own words—‘just
as an appetiser—an hors d’œuvre, don’t you
know,’ used to give them to their victims to examine
before they commenced to torture them.</p>

<p>“At the conclusion of this exhibition I managed somehow
to get away, and was walking to the elevator, when I
saw something slink past us. I turned round, and in the
gloom could only see, indistinctly, the form of a man of
medium height, with a thick-set, brutal figure, and
ambling gait. I could not see his face. He seemed to
walk right through the door, which was shut, into the
room we had just vacated. ‘What is it?’ Mr. Hoonigan
asked. Somewhat nervously, I told him. ‘Ah,’ he said,
‘that’s only one of them, and one of the least terrifying.
You didn’t know, I suppose, that the house is haunted.
From your description I should say that what you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
just seen is the ghost of the burglar I told you about.
But there are other ghosts—if you like to term them so—that
are most troublesome. I have had to give up
sleeping on this landing. I sleep on the ground floor
now, with the electric light full on, all night.’”</p>

<p>The case of the Boston ghost came to my notice in a
very direct fashion. I only stayed in the town two
nights, and chance led me to put up in an hotel which I
learned bore an undeniable reputation for being haunted.
It was in rather a poor neighbourhood—at least poor for
Boston—and there were few visitors; indeed, on the
landing where I slept, no one. I spent all my first day in
the town sight-seeing and visiting relatives whom I had
never met before, and I did not get back to the hotel till
very late. The place was dimly lit and oppressively
silent.</p>

<p>“Am I the last in?” I asked the night porter, who
rubbed his eyes wearily and yawned.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he said; “the other guests have been gone
to bed two hours or more. It’s close on one.”</p>

<p>“What part of Ireland do you come from?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“County Limerick, to be sure,” he said; “but you
couldn’t tell I was Irish!”</p>

<p>“At once,” I said. “What were you over there?”</p>

<p>“I was working on the roads,” he said, “and before
that I was in the Army—in the Inniskillings.”</p>

<p>“What date?” I enquired.</p>

<p>He told me, and it then transpired that he had enlisted
in that regiment when one of my uncles was a major in it,
and he remembered him well. We were thus talking
away and recalling episodes of the long past, when I
heard a familiar sliding kind of noise, and broke off in the
middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>“Surely, that’s the elevator,” I exclaimed. “I hope
our talking has not disturbed anyone.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill3"></a>
<img src="images/ill3.jpg" width="439" height="627" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>“But there are other ghosts—if you like to term them so—that
are more troublesome”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir,” he said. “At any rate, I
shouldn’t trouble myself about it.” His voice sounded so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
strange, I thought, and there was such an odd, furtive
look in his eyes, that I became curious, and walking
across the hall, arrived on the other side, just in time to
see the elevator come slowly and softly down.</p>

<p>To my astonishment there was no one in it.</p>

<p>“How’s that happened?” I remarked. “No one
called it, and had they done so we must have seen them.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, sir,” the porter replied, looking very
uneasy.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s certainly rather odd,” I ejaculated. “Anyhow,
it’s chosen to come down at a very convenient
moment.” And, getting in, I went up.</p>

<p>The following night I returned late, and entered the
vestibule of the hotel just as the elevator stopped.</p>

<p>“Does it come down at the same time every night?”
I asked the porter.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he muttered, “every night.”</p>

<p>“And the reason?—there must, of course, be some
reason. An elevator can’t start off unless someone or
something starts it.” He was silent. “I see there’s
some mystery attached to it,” I persisted. “What is
it? Tell me.” He remained obdurate for some seconds,
but eventually succumbed.</p>

<p>“For goodness sake, don’t let on, sir,” he said,
“because the boss has forbidden any of the staff to
mention it, and if he found out I’d told you, he’d sack me
at once. This hotel is haunted. Several years ago,
before my time, a visitor arrived here late one night and
was found by the day porter dead in the lift. How he
died was never exactly known; it was rumoured he had
either committed suicide or been murdered. It was never
found out who he was or where he came from, and, as he
had no money on him, he was buried like a pauper. Well,
sir, ever since then that elevator has taken it into its head
to set itself in motion at the same time every night.
Sometimes the gates clang just as if someone were getting
in and out. At first I usedn’t to like it at all. You can
imagine, perhaps, what it’s like to know that you are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
only person about in a place of this sort—and then to
hear the elevator suddenly beginning to descend. However,
by degrees, I got accustomed to it, and if that was
all that happened, I shouldn’t mind.”</p>

<p>“What else does happen?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, sir. Would you like a bit of
exercise?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” I said. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Will you try the staircase, then, instead of the
elevator? Count the stairs and note carefully when you
come to the forty-first.”</p>

<p>I agreed. The stairs were narrow and tortuous, the
light meagre, and soon I began to feel very, very far from
my friend the porter, and very much alone in the building.
This feeling increased the further I proceeded, until,
at last, it became so unbearable that I involuntarily
halted. I had conscientiously counted the steps. I was
at the thirty-ninth. I looked around me. High over
head was a kind of funnel formed of black, funereal, and
apparently never-ending banisters; below me was a
similarly constructed pit. The flickering gas-light
brought into play innumerable shadows. I tried to look
away from them, for their gambols were unpleasantly
emphasized by the ominously oppressive silence, but they
fascinated me to such an extent that I was forced to
watch them, and, whilst I was thus engaged, I became
suddenly aware of a presence. Something I could not
see was standing on the staircase, a few steps ahead,
barring my way. I advanced one step, and with a
tremendous effort I struggled on to the next one. Then
the most frightful, the most overwhelming, diabolical
terror seized me, and turning round, I tore downstairs.</p>

<p>“Well,” the door porter said, “you’ve come back.
Couldn’t pass it. No one who tries to do so at this time of
night ever can.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I gasped. “What is the beastly
thing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied; “no one knows. This
place was once a madhouse, I believe, and <span class="nobreak">perhaps——”</span></p>

<p>“Ah, well,” I said, “I can understand it now. Thank
goodness I’m leaving to-morrow, and as it’s a choice of
two evils, I’ll go up in the lift.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subt">A HAUNTED WOOD AND A HAUNTED QUARRY IN CANADA</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">All</span> my ghostly experiences in the United States were of
indoor hauntings, consisting mostly of the visitation of
phantasms of the dead, who in earthly form had either
suffered or committed some deed of violence. I never
met with a psychic experience out-of-doors, though I
only too well realised the possibilities of such when I was
sleeping by myself on the ranche in Oregon, or riding
alone through the giant forests of the Cascades mountains.</p>

<p>I believe all the loneliest parts of America, the great,
bold Rockies, the vast Californian and Oregon forests are
periodically visited by ghosts—ghosts of murdered
soldiers, of scalp-raising Indians, of tramp suicides—of
all manner of evilly-disposed white and red people, and of
neutrarians, spirits that have never inhabited earthly
bodies, and which are as grotesque and awe-inspiring as
the fantastically carved boulders and queerly shaped tree
trunks with which those parts are so lavishly bestrewn.</p>

<p>America, indeed, affords one of the wildest fields in the
world for the genuine ghost hunter. I use the word
genuine advisedly, for I would differentiate between the
ghost hunter who is genuine, and the professor of physics,
who expects the Unknown to be subservient to his beck
and call. I say, then, for the ghost hunter with a kindly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sympathetic nature, the ghost hunter whose thoughts are
more often on the spiritual than the material plane, and
who would earnestly seek the chance to succour and
comfort a lost soul, the United States of America gives
the greatest scope.</p>

<p>From what I have heard, for I have never been there,
Canada also is a much haunted country. An account of a
haunting there was given me by a French Canadian,
Bertram Armand, whom I met with his wife one day at
an hotel in New York. Though born and educated in
Canada, he had served in the French Army, and had
spent a considerable portion of his life in France and
Algiers. He had now retired, and it was on the occasion
of his quittal of the Army and return to Canada that the
event I am about to narrate, and which I give as nearly
as possible in his own words, <span class="nobreak">occurred:—</span></p>

<p>“My home,” he began, “was in a small town called
Garvois,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to the South-West of Winnipeg, which, at the
time of my adventure, some ten or twelve years ago, was
nothing like the size it is now.</p>

<p>“I had got out of the train at Winnipeg, and dined at
an hotel, and the evening was well set in before I rose
from my comfortable seat before the fire and prepared
for my long tramp.</p>

<p>“‘If you take my advice, sir,’ the landlord said, ‘you
will avoid the wood of Garvois after dark.’ ‘And why,
pray?’ I asked. ‘Because, sir,’ he responded, ‘because
it bears an evil reputation.’</p>

<p>“‘An evil reputation!’ I laughed. ‘Ma foi! it must
bear a very evil reputation, a positively devilish reputation,
to frighten an old soldier like me. Why, man alive,
I have served in the French Army in the wildest regions
of Algiers for years. A wood with an evil reputation,
mille tonnerres,—that’s a joke I shan’t forget in a hurry.’
Then seeing him look glum, I remarked, for I had no wish
to hurt his feelings, ‘I can appreciate your intended kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
but you see I have been away from home for ten
years—ten whole years, and I am dying to see my father.
He is the only relative I have—therefore you can gather
that I want to go by the quickest route, and the road
through the wood, if I remember rightly, is twice as
short as that by the plain. Is it not so?’</p>

<p>“The landlord shrugged his shoulders. ‘Yes,’ he said,
‘the road over the plain is longer—certainly it is longer—and
if you go by it you won’t arrive at your father’s
house till morning, but, monsieur, if you go by the wood
you may never reach home at all.’</p>

<p>“‘I will risk it,’ I laughed; ‘there can only be robbers
or wolves, and I am prepared for either. I have these!’
And I tapped the ends of two six-shooters. ‘At all
events, if anything happens, I will haunt the wood, and
you may come and see me. Au revoir!’ I waved my
hand as I spoke, and putting my pack in the proper
place on my back, I stepped airily on to the broad, brown
track leading to Garvois.</p>

<p>“Within an hour of my departure, the weather, which
had been abominably cloudy for the time of the year,
took a sudden turn for the worse, and the rain descended
in torrents. I chuckled grimly, Mr. O’Donnell, for what
after all are the discomforts of sodden clothes and
squishy boots compared with what a soldier has to
undergo in Africa—in the Sahara, where the sun is hell
and the insects—devils. Rain, Mon Dieu! What’s rain!
On and on I tramped, whistling gaily and running my
hand over my pack now and again to see that everything
was safe. I had a present there for my father, whom I
loved more than anyone else in the world. ‘You see,’ he
added with a smile, ‘I hadn’t met Jacqueline then.’</p>

<p>“Well, so long as I kept to the main track there was
not much to complain about—it had recently been
attended to, but the moment I turned off it, and on to the
side one leading to the wood, my troubles began. Deep
ruts, big holes, huge earth mounds, and sharp-edged
stones made it bad enough in dry weather; it was now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
quagmire—a quagmire that afforded every possibility of
soon becoming dangerous.</p>

<p>“I had seen nothing like it since I was in Algiers, but,
bah! a soldier can get used to anything. ‘It is a mere
nothing,’ I said to myself. ‘I can dive, I can swim; it
will take more than cold water to kill me; and if it were
twenty times as bad I would face it.’ Ten years is a long
time to be away from one’s home, Mr. O’Donnell. I
trudged on, and was soon ankle-deep in black mud. At
eight o’clock I was confronted by a long line of huge,
black trees, that bent their dripping tops as if they had
orders to salute me. Coming to a halt, and leaning
against a slender, isolated pine, that creaked and
groaned in the rough night air, I ruefully surveyed the
prospect in front of me. The track through the wood
was twelve miles—nothing of a walk if I had been fresh
and the weather dry, but in my present condition a
seemingly impossible one. For the last hour or so I had
experienced nothing but a recurrence of slips and falls,
I had done nothing but plunge in and out of abysses, and
I had been completely battered to pieces by the wind.
And the rain! I can stand any amount of heat, Mr.
O’Donnell, but wet, no, it gets into every pore of my skin
and completely demoralises me. I was exhausted,
almost at the end of my tether, and I felt a very little
more would see me on the ground, absolutely done.
Now, of course, I am used to sleeping out of doors all
night; but, then, Canada is not France, neither is it
Africa, and the warmth and dryness of the Sahara had
made me terribly susceptible to chills. A night in this
wood would mean for certain either pneumonia or
rheumatic fever—and I might never get home to see my
father. So what alternative was there? Only to tramp
back again over that dreadful track, and take the long
route over the plains. I couldn’t do it; I hadn’t the
strength. I would struggle on. I did so—I took the
plunge. The desert, with the lights twinkling far away on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
its extremities, was speedily hidden from view; trees shut
me in on all sides; I was at last in the forest. I had never
known what it was to be nervous, but the silence I now
experienced disquieted me. I had never felt anything
like it. It struck me as an assumed silence—assumed
purposely to cloak a deep-rooted and universal resentment.
Moreover, I had an uncomfortable suspicion that
it was the prelude to something hostile—to some
peculiar antagonistic demonstration, the very nature of
which was at present enigmatical. It was a silence
savouring of a world other than ours—of a world I knew
nothing about—indeed, at that period of my life I was an
atheist, and neither believed in a God or a future existence.
The rain pattered heavily on the foliage overhead,
and the wind groaned, but the voices—the voices of the
beings in this Unknown World—were still, absolutely
still. In the gloom the trees assumed strange shapes;
their motions, too, were strange—so strange that I did
not think they could possibly have been caused by the
wind. You may think I am hyper-imaginative, Mr.
O’Donnell, but I do not think I am; my wife would tell
me if I were, for she has never been slow in pointing out
my faults, have you, Jacqueline?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Armand smiled. “No, Mr. O’Donnell,” she said,
“he has many faults, but exaggeration is not one of
them; indeed, he is so precise as to be sometimes dull.”</p>

<p>Mr. Armand continued: “I saw lights, too, Mr.
O’Donnell,” he said; “all kinds of coloured lights, which
I did not then attribute to possible spirit agency. I
simply did not know what they were. I was not afraid,
but I became wary, and moved furtively forward, as if I
had been scouting in some enemy’s country. Every now
and then I fancied I heard soft steps that I could associate
with nothing human, stealing surreptitiously behind me.
I paused and looked carefully over my shoulder, but there
was nothing visible—only the gloom. At length the
darkness became so intense that I could no longer see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
track. I continued to advance, however, and after
plunging through a succession of bogs and briars was
finally brought to a peremptory halt by a stone wall.
This wall was four feet or so in height, but what lay on
the other side of it, or where indeed it began or ended, it
was impossible to decide, and I was wondering what on
earth I had better do next—for my energy was nearly
spent—when a voice suddenly called out, ‘Keep along by
the wall and I will meet you at the wicket gate!’ Overjoyed,
I obeyed. The wall swerved sharply round, and a
few yards beyond, with one hand on the gate and in the
other a dark lantern, stood the slight, muffled-up figure of
a woman. In a few words I explained the situation—how
in the blinding rain and darkness of the forest I had
lost my way, and was too exhausted to go any further.
‘I don’t mind sleeping anywhere,’ I pleaded, ‘so long as
I can lie where it is dry and rest till morning. An attic,
barn, anything will do.’</p>

<p>“‘I think I can offer you something better than that,’
the woman responded, as she led me through the gate and
along a narrow winding path to a large, low, rakish-looking
house, whose black walls, rising suddenly out of
the ground before me, seemed startlingly familiar. My
guide halted—a key turned, a door flew open—there was
a rush of strange, musty air, and almost before I had
time to realise it, I was inside the building. ‘I must
apologise for the absence of light,’ the woman said, ‘but
under the circumstances the omission is unavoidable. If
we had been expecting you, it would, of course, have been
different. If you will follow me, I will take you to your
room.’ I tried to see her face, to make out what she was
like, but I was frustrated in my desire by the way in
which she held the lantern. Nor was I any more fortunate
in the discernment of my surroundings; I could
see the ground at my feet, but no more; all—everything—was
shrouded in an impenetrable, sable mantle. The
curious feeling that I had been there before, that I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the house well, again came over me, although prior to
now I had never seen any habitation in the wood, nor
even known that one existed. I argued it was probably a
scent—some peculiar odour in the atmosphere that had
conjured back memories of some other and quite distinct
place; but I had not much time for speculation, as the
woman’s movements were very quick, and I had barely
scraped the thickest of the mud from off my feet before
she had begun to ascend a luxuriously-carpetted staircase.
We crossed what I took to be a landing, and
stepped some score or so paces down a corridor, finally
halting before a half-open doorway.</p>

<p>“‘There is your room,’ she said. ‘You need have no
fear—the linen is well aired, and of course,’ she added,
slightly sniffing, ‘you may, if you like, open the windows.
We have been obliged to keep them closed, owing to the
damp. Good-night!’</p>

<p>“She turned to go, and just for the fraction of a
second I saw her face. It was exquisite. My wife will
pardon me for saying my wildest dreams of woman’s
beauty were not merely rivalled, they were surpassed. I
doubt even if so great a painter of feminine charms as
Richter could have done her credit. Who was she? I
kept asking myself that question long after she had left
me, and the echoes of her high-heeled shoes along the
passage and down the stairs had ceased. Who was she?
Ma foi! The vision of such loveliness would never leave
me. I would enjoy them over and over again in my
sleep. Indeed, I was so obsessed with her face that I paid
little or no heed to the novelty of the situation. At other
times I might have queried the desirability of being in a
strange bedroom in a strange house—in the dark. But
the knowledge she was near at hand was quite enough for
me. I was already in love with her—and the queerest, the
most perplexing of predicaments were as nothing to me.
I soared above—God alone knew how high above—dilemmas.
Still, when I came to argue it out with myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it was a bit of a nuisance my matches were sodden and I
could not use them. I would have preferred seeing the
bed upon which I was to lie, and a spot where I could lay
my clothes. I was so afraid of soiling the upholstery that
I undressed where I stood, and then, making a guess at
the direction of the bed, walked cautiously forward. By
a piece of luck, which struck me as somewhat extraordinary,
I collided with the bedstead—a large brass one—almost
immediately.</p>

<p>“It was the work of a second to throw back the sheets
and scramble in between them, and then, with my mind
full to overflowing with visions of my newly-found
goddess, I entrusted both her and my father to the safe
keeping of the Virgin and the Saints—this though I had
no faith in a future for myself—and sank into a deep
refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>“How long I remained in that condition I never knew.
I woke with a start to find the room no longer dark, but
partially illuminated with a fitful red glow which proceeded
from the stove, now full of lurid logs. Thinking I
must be dreaming, I rubbed my eyes. But no; the fire
was still there, and even as I gazed at it I caught the
sound of approaching footsteps—the sharp rat-tat of
high-heeled shoes. Nearer and nearer they came, right
up to the entrance of my room, when, to my astonishment
and no little embarrassment, the door gently
opened, and in tip-toed the object of my admiration. In
one hand she carried a long-handled iron spoon, and in
the other a candle. I was entranced. Now that she had
taken off her hood and cloak, beauties hitherto concealed
stood out in dazzling fulness and bewitched me.
Never had I seen such a wealth of rich golden hair, such a
perfect nose and chin, such tiny ears, carmine lips, white
teeth, black-lashed, china-blue eyes, white tapering
fingers, rosy, almond-shaped nails, and such a heavenly
figure. My wife, Mr. O’Donnell, bears me no animosity.
You don’t, do you, Jacqueline?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” Mrs. Armand laughed. “I understand you.
All men are the same. Go on and tell Mr. O’Donnell
more about your goddess.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” Bertram Armand exclaimed. “She
was a goddess—at least my idea of one, then. What did
she want? I sat up in bed, and was about to speak to
her, when she laid a finger on her lips and smilingly bade
me be silent. She then glided to the grate, and taking
from her pocket a small lump of lead, carefully put it into
the spoon, which she balanced with the utmost care on
the brightest of the faggots. That done, she again
smiled meaningly at me, and walking to the dainty
dressing-table, strewn profusely with rings and bracelets,
looked long and critically at herself in the mirror. It
was while she was thus occupied that I suddenly became
conscious of something or someone close to me. In a
moment my heart ceased to beat; in deadly fear I
glanced round, and perceived, lying by my side, an old
man with long, grizzled hair and beard, whose features
were somehow vaguely familiar to me. He was sound
asleep—a fact betrayed by his breathing, which was loud
and stertorious. A slight movement from the other part
of the room attracting my attention, I looked up, just in
time to see the girl flash me a look of subtle warning.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t wake him, whatever you do,’ her eyes said;
‘he <em>must</em> sleep on.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t wake him,’ I repeated to myself; ‘why, of
course I won’t. I wouldn’t do anything—no matter what—if
you told me not to; I would obey you even at the
risk of life and soul!’ Dieu en ciel! How lovely!</p>

<p>“Cautiously—first one daintily clad foot and then the
other—the girl approached the stove. She lifted the
spoon carefully from the fire, bore it steadily before her
to the bed, and gaily motioning to me to keep quiet, she
gently turned the sleeper’s head over on the pillow, and
with a dexterous movement of her clever, supple fingers,
poured the seething, hissing lead into his ear. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
an agonising scream—the eyes of the old man opened
convulsively, and in the brief glimpse I caught of them, I
recognised my father.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>“I looked up, just in time to see the girl flash me a look
of subtle warning”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Almost simultaneously came a loud crash, blinding
darkness, and I was once again in the forest—God knows
how—pursuing my way laboriously along the mud-laden
track.</p>

<p>“At early dawn I arrived within sight of Garvois—Garvois
bathed in a cold grey mist, and a little later I
dragged myself with difficulty towards the wicket gate
leading to my father’s house. To my intense surprise it
was padlocked, but the mystery explained itself at once—standing
upright in the garden was a notice-board, bearing
the inscription, ‘To be Let or Sold.’ I swayed on my
feet as I looked at it, and with a bursting heart reeled
away to the nearest house—the house of my old friend,
Henry Crozier.</p>

<p>“Henry had just awakened—he invariably got up at
five—and shuffling downstairs, he opened the door.</p>

<p>“‘Le diable!’ he exclaimed, ‘if it isn’t Bertram!
Ma foi! I was dreaming of you last night. So you’ve
come back!’</p>

<p>“‘Come back to find the place empty!’ I murmured.
‘But, tell me, my friend, where’s my father?’</p>

<p>“Henry’s eyes grew round with astonishment.
‘What!’ he said. ‘What! you don’t know?’ Then,
seeing my look of utter stupefaction, he added: ‘My
poor Bertram! Your father is dead! He died a fortnight
ago, the very day after his marriage with Mademoiselle
Marie Dernille, the niece of his last housekeeper.
What killed him? Apoplexy. It does not do to dispute
the doctor.’</p>

<p>“‘But the woman—the woman? What was she
like?’ I stuttered.</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ Harry enunciated slowly, ‘she was what
some people would call beautiful, though, as God is my
judge, I did not admire her. Fair, very fair, a mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
washed-out yellow hair, painted lips—oh, yes, anyone
could see they were painted—and big, very big eyes—china-blue
and smiling—name of a name—eternally
smiling.’”</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span></p>

<p>This was Bertram Armand’s account of his experience.
In answer to my questions he told me that he had
searched the wood thoroughly, but there was no house of
any sort in it, and afterwards, having had his father’s
body secretly exhumed, and finding lead in the ear, he
had obtained an order for the arrest of his step-mother.
She was, however, nowhere to be found, and he supposed
that, having got wind of the affair, she had escaped out
of the country.</p>

<p>Armand told his story with every appearance of
sincerity, and as I could see that his wife believed it, I
have no doubt at all that it was true.</p>

<p>The case of another haunting in Canada was told me on
my way out to the States, on board one of the White Star
Liners.</p>

<p>My place at table was next to a Doctor and Mrs.
Fanshawe, both Canadians, who, hearing that I was
interested in everything connected with the superphysical,
told me that they had had several rather
curious experiences. The doctor took from his breast-pocket
a small leather purse, and, opening it, showed me
a dull, blue stone.</p>

<p>“Are you a geologist?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “I know nothing whatever about
stones. What is it?”</p>

<p>“No one has ever been able to tell me,” he said. “I
have shown it to several Professors at the English
Universities and they have each classified it differently.
Not one of them, I believe, had ever seen or even heard of
a stone like it. And for a very simple reason. In Canada
there is much soil that has never been disturbed, and
many tracts of land no white man has ever trod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“But let me explain how the stone came into my
possession. Five years ago we took a house situated
about four or five miles from Montreal. It was a long,
low, two storey house, standing a little back from the
road, and connected with it by a semi-circular sweep of
gravel road. Opposite the house was a large pit, where
quarrying had recently been begun, but had been discontinued,
owing to the calcinous nature of the rock,
which rendered it of little use for building purposes.
Incessant rains had formed a deep pool in the bottom of
the pit, and the water possessed this idiosyncrasy—the
weather made no difference to its temperature—it was
icy cold in summer and winter alike.</p>

<p>“Viewed in the day-time, the quarry struck one as
ordinary enough. It was at dusk, when the shadows
from the trees and bushes swept across the road and
dimmed the mouth of the great pit, that it impressed one
as unsavoury. I remember marvelling at this metamorphosis
the first day of our arrival. It was July, and the
landscape was vividly aglow with brilliant, scintillating
sunbeams. A more radiant scene you could not imagine.
‘One might make a capital swimming bath of this,’ I
remarked to my wife, as we wandered to the edge of the
pit and peered down into the silent, sparkling water.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ she laughed. ‘Supposing we start right
away. I never appreciate a bath more than after a
journey.’</p>

<p>“That was in the morning. In the evening the place
produced a very different impression. We had dinner—the
sort of scratch meal one must expect when one is
‘moving in,’ and I had strolled out alone. I first of all
explored the premises. There was a big garden with an
orchard alongside, and a small field beyond; and I
pictured to myself how nice it would all look when
the grass was properly cut and the flower-beds
planted by my wife, who, by the way, thoroughly
understands landscape gardening. You do, don’t you,
Mabel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fanshawe nodded, and her husband resumed his
story.</p>

<p>“I lit another cigar and walked out into the road to
have a look at the quarry. I hardly recognised it. It
seemed, since the morning, to have undergone a complete
change. The banks appeared higher and more
precipitous, the water blacker and infinitely deeper, and
there was a cold dreariness about the place that made me
shiver. I thought I had never viewed anything so
utterly forlorn and murderous. On the opposite bank
were a few rank sedges and several white trunks of
decayed trees. I had not noticed them before, but now,
as I gazed down at the pool, I saw their re-modelled and
inverted images outlined with a clearness that more than
rivalled that of their material counterparts.</p>

<p>“I was pondering over this phenomenon, when I
suddenly felt I was being watched, and, raising my eyes,
I perceived on the bank facing me, just out of reach of
the water, a boulder of ebony-black and grotesquely-wrought
rock. I could not see anything behind it, but I
was convinced that something was there, something that
was crouching on its haunches and glaring savagely at
me. I also felt convinced that this thing, which I could
not actually see—though I knew for certain it was there—was
some strange hybrid of a man and animal; a
thing with limbs like ours, but the face of some fantastic,
mocking, malevolent beast.</p>

<p>“Filled with a great uneasiness and all manner of
vague fears, I hurried back to the house, where all was
bright and cheerful, but I could not rid my mind of the
impression it had taken from the pool, and that night
my dreams were troubled and alarming.</p>

<p>“I said nothing about it to my wife, but two days
later, when I was mending my fishing-rod in the study,
she came to me in a great state of agitation. ‘Why,
what’s the matter, Mabel?’ I asked anxiously; ‘you
look very white! Are you ill?’ ‘No,’ she said. ‘I’ve
only had a shock.’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>At the doctor’s request, Mrs. Fanshawe then took up
the thread.</p>

<p>“I was walking down one of the side-paths of the
garden,” she said, “looking for Ephraim (Ephraim was
our gardener), when I heard a great rustling of leaves. I
turned round and saw a violent agitation going on in the
branches of an apple-tree. Much mystified, as I could
see no cause for it, I approached nearer, and as I did so
I distinctly heard some heavy body drop to the earth
with a thud; I then felt something brush past me. I
can’t exactly describe the sensation it caused, because it
is beyond words. I can only say I felt I was being
touched by something immeasurably foul and antagonistic.
I reeled right back, and that moment someone
spoke. It was the gardener who came running towards
me to ask if he could go home, as his wife had suddenly
been taken ill.”</p>

<p>“That was all that happened, then?”</p>

<p>“No,” Mrs. Fanshawe replied. “That night, after we
had been in bed some time, we were awakened by hearing
our Newfoundland dog, Pat, bark. I went downstairs to
see what was the matter with him—he slept in the house—and
found him standing in the hall with his hair all
erect, looking at the window by the front door.</p>

<p>“I called to my husband, and he came down with his
revolver. We then both went to the window and looked
out, but could see no one. ‘I’m sure Pat sees something,’
I observed; ‘he is beside himself with terror.’ ‘What is
it, Pat?’ Dick said, and was about to stroke him, when
there came a violent hammering at the door. We looked
at one another in dismay. ‘Who’s there?’ Dick cried,
and, there being no reply, he fired—the bullet going
right through the door. We threw it open—there was no
one there. We then searched the garden (nothing would
persuade Pat to accompany us), but we found no one.</p>

<p>“For a week after this incident we were undisturbed;
then all sorts of noises were heard in the house—soft
footsteps, heavy breathing, the rattling of door handles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and—most alarming of all—loud crashes on the door
panels. The servants were terrified. One of them
roused us one night by loud shrieks, and going to her
room, we found her in hysterics. All the clothes had been
stripped off her bed and thrown in a promiscuous heap on
the floor. When she recovered sufficiently to speak, she
told us something had come into her room and tried to
suffocate her—she felt just as if all the breath in her body
was being forcibly sucked out of her. She had seen
nothing. We told her it was a nightmare, and tried to
soothe her, but our endeavours met with little success,
and in the morning she was seriously ill. She died within
a fortnight, and on the same day as the gardener’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Did the gardener’s wife live on the premises, too?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Practically,” Mrs. Fanshawe replied. “She and her
husband occupied a cottage close to.”</p>

<p>“Did both women usually have good health?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” Dr. Fanshawe laughed; “they were as
tough as horses—rosy-cheeked, strong-limbed, typical
young Canadians. Heart and lungs absolutely sound. I
diagnosed their cases and was much puzzled. On the
top of violent shocks, which had apparently upset their
whole constitution, they had developed acute anæmia.
Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Merely because of an idea,” I replied; “but pray let
Mrs. Fanshawe finish her story, and then, if you like, I
will tell you what my idea is.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Fanshawe continued, “I haven’t much
more to relate. On the night after our maid’s funeral,
we were again disturbed by Pat barking. I got up and
went to the bedroom window. The weather was very
unsettled. Clouds scurried across the moon, that hung
like a great silver ball over the St. Lawrence River,
which I could see winding its mighty course in the
distance; spots of heavy rain were falling, and the wind
whistled dolefully through the leaves of the maples.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill5"></a>
<img src="images/ill5.jpg" width="396" height="629" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>“The Thing came right up to the window, and then raised
its face”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Suddenly I heard the sound of heavy footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
crunching their way along the gravel drive. ‘It will be
nothing visible,’ I said to myself, and then I got a pretty
acute shock. Coming towards the house with short,
quick steps was a tall figure, with its head bowed low.
Its arms and legs were very long and bony, the feet and
hands enormous. It was quite nude, and from all over
its body, which was of an exaggerated whiteness, there
emanated a strange, phosphorescent glow. I called to
Dick, and he at once joined me. The Thing came right up
to the window, and then raised its face. If I live to be a
thousand years old I shall never forget what I saw. The
proportion of the face was not human, and it was partially
covered with hair, but the eyes were the same
shape as ours, only very much bigger. They were pale,
almost white, I thought, and their <span class="nobreak">expression——”</span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk of it,” Dr. Fanshawe interrupted. “One
can only say it was too damnable, too utterly vicious and
loathsome for words.”</p>

<p>“We were so overcome,” his wife went on, “that for
some seconds neither of us could articulate a syllable.
We both stared at it in hideous fascination. At last it
made some slight movement, and Dick, released from the
spell that held him, fired at it. The bullet must have
gone right through it, for we saw the gravel on the path
immediately behind it spurt up and scatter. However,
the figure was unharmed, and it moved on towards the
front door. Dick fired again, but with no better result.
A fearful horror now seized us, lest it should get into the
house. I am not a religious woman, but I prayed, and as
I did so I saw Dick throw something. What he threw
seemed to strike the thing full in the face, and it vanished.
As we got back into bed, I said to Dick, ‘That
was very odd! What did you throw?’”</p>

<p>“‘A stone I picked up near the quarry this morning,’
he replied. ‘I don’t know why I threw it, but directly
you started praying, a feeling came over me that I must.’</p>

<p>“We were not disturbed again that night, but slept
better than we had done for some time, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
morning Dick found and showed me the stone—the stone
you are looking at now. We had it fixed to the front
door, and after that we were not troubled again.”</p>

<p>“There was no history attached to the place,” Dr.
Fanshawe added, “and no one we spoke to had ever
heard of its being haunted. Now, what do you make
of it?”</p>

<p>“A fairly satisfactory case,” I replied, “because I
think this stone affords a clue to part of the mystery at
least. When I was out in the West, I was told by some
Indians of the Rogue River tribe, whom I was delighted
to fall in with, that when a place of theirs was haunted,
they kept the ghost quiet by burying a piece of blue rock,
which is to be found in the lava beds of that district, but
is very rare. Now in all probability this custom is not
confined to the Indians of one tribe, but is more or less
universal; therefore we need not be surprised to find a
piece of this blue rock buried elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“But there are no Indians in this neighbourhood,”
Mrs. Fanshawe remarked.</p>

<p>“Not now,” I said, “but undoubtedly there were
once. My supposition is that this place has a history. It
was once badly haunted by spirits of the most dangerous
type, which, for want of a better name, I will style
neutrarians.</p>

<p>“These neutrarians are spirits that have never inhabited
material bodies, and are only to be found in very
remote and isolated districts, where the soil has rarely if
ever been disturbed. They are invariably antagonistic
to all forms of animal life, probably, because, if they were
created first, which is quite feasible, they regard man as
an interloper, and, probably, also because they covet
man’s body and are jealous of him. Many of the Indians
believe that man is descended from the gods, and neutrarians
from devils, and that the latter feel the distinction
and hate man accordingly. Neutrarians vary
considerably both in appearance, habits and constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Whilst some can apparently reveal themselves at will,
others can only do so by stealing vitality from human
beings or animals. Let us now see how all of this applies
to the present case. When you came to your house you
did not get the impression it was haunted; it was only
when you looked at the quarry—it was there you received
your first impressions—and they were, in all probability,
correct. I believe a great deal in first impressions, particularly
with regard to the superphysical. This theory,
too, namely, that the hauntings originated in the quarry,
finds support in the fact that you found the blue stone
close to the quarry, and that the figure you both saw
coming along the carriage drive was coming from that
direction. The blue stone, I believe, had been buried
there and was dug up when the quarry was made; thus
the stopper, so to speak, which kept the ghost in check
being removed, the hauntings of course recommenced.
Belonging to the species that cannot manifest itself without
drawing vitality from some form or other of animal
life, this neutrarian first attacked the gardener’s wife, and
then the maid, selecting these two on account of their
unusual robustness. Had you not thrown the blue stone
at it, and afterwards fixed the stone to your door, it is
more than likely that you would both have succumbed.”</p>

<p>“Then many diseases that have defied diagnosis, and
there are countless such,” Dr. Fanshawe exclaimed,
“may very probably be due to neutrarians.”</p>

<p>“I think it is very likely,” I said. “I have noticed,
for example, houses, where several people have been
medically stated to have died of cancer, have been
haunted by disturbances of a parallel nature to those you
experienced.”</p>

<p>“But are such hauntings to go on for ever?” Mrs.
Fanshawe asked. “Is there no means of putting an end
to them, saving by blue stones? How about exorcism?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure on that point,” I said. “I certainly do
not think that neutrarians or the spirits of imbeciles can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
be exorcised satisfactorily, as I have known several cases
of hauntings by these spirits in which exorcism has been
practised, and in no instance has it had any effect whatsoever.
I should say hauntings by neutrarians might
last indefinitely; I see no reason why they should not.
Have you made any enquiries lately about the house?”</p>

<p>“No,” Mrs. Fanshawe replied, “not for some time.
When we get back to Montreal, we will do so, and let you
know.” The conversation ended here.</p>

<p>A year later I received a letter from her husband.
“I have been to the house,” he wrote, “and the present
occupants are leaving almost immediately. There have
been three deaths there during their tenancy, and they
complain of exactly the same disturbances that alarmed
us. I have lent them the blue stone.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subt">HAUNTINGS IN THE EAST END</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Having</span> come to the conclusion that it was quite impossible
to earn a living in America, I returned to England
as a steerage passenger on the German liner “Elbe.”</p>

<p>It was the last homeward journey she was destined to
go, for she was run into on her next outward voyage by
the “Crathie,” several hundred miles off the East Coast
of England, and sunk with an appalling loss of life. The
weather being particularly rough, we were about nine days
at sea; and the fact that our quarters were extremely
close, consisting of little more than a square foot to each
person, coupled with food that I could not eat, made me
sincerely thankful when the time came to go ashore.
Apart from these details I had nothing to complain of in
the way I was treated, for the crew—though barely concealing
their hearty contempt for all but the first-class
passengers—were to me civil enough. At the same time
the experience—an experience I had not bargained for—was
one I certainly do not desire to go through again.</p>

<p>I shall never forget how glad I was to find myself once
more in an English restaurant, sitting down to a good,
square English meal. I spent two nights in Southampton,
travelling thence to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving at Waterloo, I found myself almost as
embarrassed as I had been in New York, for my knowledge
of London was extremely limited. I had only been
there—excepting when I was up for my Sandhurst Exam.—for
an odd day occasionally, and then I had always
stayed at a private hotel in Cambridge Street, Hyde
Park. Now, however, my funds being no longer equal
to the West End, I was forced to look elsewhere for a
lodging. After a wearisome search, I at last found a
room in Tennyson Street, S.E. That room will take a lot
of forgetting. It was very small, very dark, and very
beetly. I could hear whole armies of blackbeetles
parading the floor and scaling the walls. Occasionally,
one dropped with a thud seemingly close to me, and I
sprang out of bed in terror, lest it had landed on the
counterpane. I honestly believe I am as much afraid of
cockroaches as I am of ghosts.</p>

<p>I only stayed in that house three days, and then moved
into the attic of a coffee tavern in York Road. That was
midway in the ‘nineties, and York Road then was very
different from what it is now. In the day-time it was full
of frowsily dressed men and women and the fœtid steam
from the cheaper kinds of restaurants.</p>

<p>I well remember one shop that boasted of hot rabbit
dinners for fourpence; and big pork pies, that had a
peculiar fascination for blue-bottles, were sold there, all
the year round, for threepence. I often wondered how
many people those pies killed, and how any man could be
such a villain as to sell them.</p>

<p>But if York Road was mean and squalid in the day-time,
it was infinitely worse at night. I have never in any
other street in London seen such an endless procession
of women of the unfortunate class. They were nearly
all German, and their hard, cruel faces should have
been a sufficient warning to anyone to give them a
wide berth. I haven’t the slightest doubt that many of
the young men who were foolish enough to be enticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by them were ruthlessly robbed, and not infrequently
murdered.</p>

<p>One very nasty incident took place just under my
window. It was in the depths of December, and the snow
lay thick on the ground. Will anyone who experienced
it ever forget that Christmas of 1894. I was laid up with
influenza, and was lying awake coughing, when I heard a
loud shriek, followed by an oath, and a series of groans
and gurgles. Then someone whistled, and a cab came up,
after which all was quiet for a few minutes, when a crowd
collected and a babel of voices arose.</p>

<p>In the morning my landlady, with a very white face,
told me she had seen it all through her window; she
slept in the basement, and had been too horrified to
move. It appears that, shortly before midnight, a man
had hidden in the doorway of the house, as if waiting for
someone, and about ten minutes later a woman had
come along, whom he hurled to the ground, and
stabbed. When the woman had ceased groaning, the
man whistled, and a cab came up. The driver, getting
down from his seat, helped lift the woman into the
vehicle; he and the murderer then climbed into the box,
there was the crack of a whip, and the cab was gone. A
few minutes afterwards a couple of policemen appeared
on the scene, talked for some time, and then walked away,
after which the street remained silent till dawn.</p>

<p>I went out and looked at the scene of the incident.
There was abundant evidence on the doorstep and
window-sill as to what had taken place, and seeing the
people next door looking at it, I asked them if they had
heard anything in the night. They shrugged their
shoulders. “It’s quite a common occurrence in this
neighbourhood,” they said, “and it would never do for
us to take any notice of it. If we did, we should certainly,
sooner or later, share the same fate as that woman.”
Thus, no attempt was made to bring the miscreant to
justice, and the matter ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>During the time I was with her, my landlady was
robbed twice. On the first occasion two boys came into
the front part of the shop and asked for some sandwiches.
Whilst the landlady’s daughter, who was alone behind
the counter, was serving them, one of the boys snatched
up a ham, the other threw down a chair, and both flew
out of the shop. The girl rushed after them, but of
course fell over the chair. Her cries brought her brother
Bert and me to the rescue, and we set off in pursuit of the
thieves. Although they had got some distance, Bert,
being an astonishingly fast sprinter, had nearly caught
them up, when the foremost of the boys abruptly halted,
and, whirling round, flung the ham right at him. He
ducked, and the ham landed with a splash in a puddle of
rain water. Picking it up, we bore it triumphantly home,
and it was soon resting on the counter, I hope—since it
was to be sold as usual—none the worse for its adventure.</p>

<p>Episode number two did not end quite so happily. A
young man with a clean-shaven face, and innocent, big
blue eyes came to look for rooms. He spoke with a
strong American accent, and said he was travelling for a
well-known firm of jewellers in Boston. Whether it was
the eyes, or thoughts of gold bracelets and pearl pendants,
I cannot say—perhaps it was both; anyhow, the
landlady’s daughter beamed on him, and from that day
forth I became a person of second importance, if, indeed,
of any importance at all. Whatever he said was law, and
whatever he chose to wear was “most elegant.” Then
something happened, for which I was not altogether unprepared.
He came down one morning carrying a somewhat
bulky parcel, which he told the landlady’s daughter
was his dress suit. “It’s too small for me,” he said.
“This bracing climate of yours has given me such an
appetite, I’ve grown fat. I’m going to take it to the
tailor down the street to see if he can enlarge it for me.
By the way, can you change me this sovereign?” He
handed her a coin, and I saw him smile tenderly. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he went out of the shop with a pile of silver in his hand—and
never came back. The sovereign was of course a bad
one, and, worse still, the dress clothes were a new suit of
Bert’s, one for which he must have given at least three
pounds.</p>

<p>I was not idle all the time I stayed in York Road. I
was thrown on my own resources and had to find some
means of making a livelihood. Expensive though my
education had been, it was of little practical use to me
now. The only subjects I knew anything about were
those required for the Sandhurst and R.I.C. Examinations,
and they in no way fitted me for business. A
board-school youth with a knowledge of book-keeping
and shorthand stood a much better chance of obtaining
a clerkship than I did. It was a bitter revelation to me.
I had always been brought up with the idea that breed
and manners were a valuable asset.</p>

<p>I now discovered that without money and influence
they were a handicap rather than otherwise. The
majority of employers I interviewed were certainly not
gentlemen, nor apparently did they care to have anything
to do with such; all they wanted was smartness in
figures and the capacity of standing prodigiously long
hours and any amount of bullying. I worked for a week
in an office in Lewisham. My employer was a kind of
jobbing stockbroker with a florid face and yards of gold
watch-chain. My hours, as far as I can remember, were
from nine to six, with twenty minutes interval for luncheon.
The second day I was there I was kept at work till
after seven, and the following day, by way of retaliation, I
took a good hour over my lunch. When I got back to the
office, I thought my employer would have died of
apoplexy. I have never seen a man in such a fury.</p>

<p>“What do you think I pay you for?” he shrieked;
“to eat?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t paid me yet,” I responded; “it will be
time enough to give way to your emotions when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have. You kept me here last night an hour longer than
the time agreed. Very good! You get an hour less work
out of me to-day. What’s sauce for the goose is sauce
for the gander.”</p>

<p>He raised his thick, podgy hand, and I thought he was
going to strike me, which I hoped he would do, for I have
always been very fond of boxing, and a scrap with him
just then would have been as nectar to me. To my
astonishment, however, he suddenly subsided, and,
walking out of the room, left me to go on with my work
undisturbed. I left the office punctually at six that
evening, and for the few remaining days I was with him,
the prearranged hours were rigidly adhered to. That was
my one and only experience in business. I tried to get on
the staff of a newspaper, but although I wrote to almost
every editor in London, I did not succeed. I am convinced
that no post, outside that of a reporter, for which
I had neither the training nor the inclination, can be
obtained without the investment of money or colossal
influence.</p>

<p>I managed, however, to do some free lance work, and I
derived no little interest and amusement, though not
much remuneration, interviewing for a weekly journal
called “Theatricals.” The first man of any note I met
was the late Sir Augustus Harris, to whom I introduced
myself on the stage of Drury Lane. It was during a
rehearsal of the pantomime, at which, if I remember
rightly, Harry Nicholls, Herbert Campbell, Dan Leno,
and many other favourites of those times were present.
Sir Augustus listened to what I had to say with great
courtesy, and told me to go to Mr. Neil Forsyth. I did so,
with the result that I was offered a small post on the staff
of the theatre. I was grateful to Mr. Forsyth, who was
one of the very kindest men that ever breathed, but apart
from the smallness of the salary, there were obstacles in
the way, and so I had to refuse.</p>

<p>About this time I met a girl with whom I became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
madly infatuated, and when she refused to marry me, I
seriously contemplated suicide. It was this episode that
gave me the central idea for my first novel, “For Satan’s
Sake,” in which I introduced the girl, and which is
written very much round my own life.</p>

<p>I am only too thankful now that she did not accept me,
for I do not know how I should have kept her, and that,
apparently, as far as she was concerned, was the only
thing that mattered.</p>

<p>I fought a desperate battle with myself for some time,
and in the end came to the grim resolution to go on
living. It was when I was recovering from this state of
excessive mental dejection that I came in contact with an
old acquaintance, a public schoolman, at whose suggestion
I decided to try schoolmastering, and consequently
obtained a post at Daventry Grammar School.</p>

<p>But I must now return to the principal subject of this
narrative, namely, ghosts.</p>

<p>During the year I was in York Road I thoroughly
explored the East End, and in the coffee houses and
restaurants of Poplar, Deptford, Tilbury and Whitechapel
I heard many first-hand accounts of hauntings.
Though it is not generally known, the East End of
London is far more haunted than the West. On one of
my nocturnal rambles, I made the acquaintance of a
Russian Jew, who had an extraordinary mania for
spiders, which he kept in specially designed boxes with
glass lids. On their half-holidays he used to set his
children to work collecting flies and other insects, and the
whole family used to revel in watching the spiders gorge
themselves on their victims. You could see he was
innately cruel by the hard twinkling of his little black
eyes, and the spasmodic twitching of his flat, greasy,
white fingers, but he was something of a scholar and he
had a devout dread of ghosts. “There is a haunted
house close to here,” he said to me one evening; “if you
like to come with me I will introduce you to the owner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
He is a Chinaman, called King Ho, or some such outlandish
name, and he keeps an opium den.”</p>

<p>King Ho did not require much of an introduction, for,
as soon as we entered, he fixed his little slit-like eyes on
me and said:</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want? A smoke?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “I’ve come to hear about your ghosts.
I’m interested in them.”</p>

<p>“There are plenty of them here,” he murmured;
“the house is full of them. Sit down!”</p>

<p>I obeyed, and the Russian Jew went back to his
spiders and left me alone with the Chinaman.</p>

<p>It was a dirty, sordid, ill-ventilated place, reeking with
a dozen different odours, and suggestive of vermin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
libitum</i>, and diseases of an Oriental origin and unspeakable
nature. A curtain was drawn across one end of the
room, and noticing that my eyes wandered off in that
direction, King Ho got up and pulled aside the drapery.
Two wooden berths, one above the other, were discovered;
the top one was empty, and the lower occupied by a
corpse-like Chinaman, who was lying on his side, facing
us, with absolutely no expression in his eyes or
mouth. He might have been dead the best part of a
week.</p>

<p>“He’s away in the rice fields of his native home,” King
Ho said, “talking to his wife and playing with his
children. He goes there every night at this time”—and
he glanced at the big, round, wooden clock hanging on
the wall.</p>

<p>“You mean he is dreaming,” I said.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” King Ho retorted. “I mean he’s there—his
spirit, his intelligence is there. That thing you are
looking at is only his material body. He, and I, and
others we know, don’t set much value on that, we can
get out of it so easily. It’s the immaterial self we
esteem.”</p>

<p>Then, seeing I was interested, he resumed his chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and stretching out his long, thin, yellow hand, he
touched me on the arm.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said, “we, Chinamen, who come from the
fields and mountains, and grow up in close touch with
Nature, can concentrate. From our infancy upwards we
think deeply. We think of the sky, the stars, the sun, the
moon, the mighty Hoang Ho River and the vast range of
the Pelings. We think of them in a sense quite different
from the sense in which you Londoners would think of
them. You would regard them as so many objects only—sky
and land-marks. We think of them as spirits that
can act as magnets to our spirits—as intelligences akin to
ourselves, that can, when once we become thoroughly acquainted
with them, draw us to them. The Pelings live
just as much as you and I live—you might pull down
their body, that great, elevated frame you style the
mountains, just as you might overturn that bench; but
the real, the spiritual Pelings would still remain. When
once you grasp the idea that all Nature lives—that everything,
even to the chairs and tables, have immaterial
representatives, then you will begin to understand the
principle of the concentration we practise. You must see
the Pelings, the Hoang-Ho, the rice fields, not as they
would appear to the man in the street here, here in
London, Piccadilly, but as we, who live near them and
know them, see them—as figures that can see and hear,
figures with intelligence, expression—intense expression
in their eyes. When you see them like that, you will get
to love them, and, when you love them, you will unconsciously
concentrate on them, as you do on all
things that you love. Your love will not be in vain, it
will be reciprocated, and the love that reciprocates yours
will, as a magnet, draw you—you—your immaterial
ego—your true self—towards it. Now you begin to
understand, I can tell by your face. The Chinaman—the
Chinaman of the plains and hills—like myself,
<em>thinks</em>—he knows Nature, and when he leaves China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and comes over here, he concentrates until he hears the
voice of that Nature calling to him; and when he
hears it, his spirit is gently freed from his material
body, and borne silently and instantaneously to his
home.</p>

<p>“Now, he can think best when he can get some at least
of the conditions of his native surroundings—and the
most important of them is silence. Not silence such as
you may understand it, but the silence of the conscious,
inanimate hills, and rivers, and plains—and the only way
to procure it is through opium—the opium I supply.
Hence he comes here, takes it, and lies over yonder, and
thinks, till he hears the call and his spirit is released.”</p>

<p>“But the ghosts,” I interrupted, “the ghosts you
spoke about.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said. “Listen! Sometimes men have
come here who have lost the love of the spirit of the
mountain and river. They have lost it because they
have liked too much this London of yours, and have imbibed
too deeply of that detestable immorality, which so
weakens the spirit that it cannot, even if it heard the call,
get away from the flesh. I tell those men that my
opium will do them no good, but they take it; they take
it, and dream as Englishmen would dream—with their
spirits chained to their material bodies. When these
depraved Chinamen awake and realise that they can
never, never again, be drawn by the mighty, majestic
love of the Spirit of the Mountain and River, and that
they can never again revisit the home of their childhood,
so bitter is their disappointment that they kill themselves—not
always here, but anywhere—in their lodgings,
in the river, or in the docks. Their spirits then
invariably come here, where, undoubtedly, they renew
their vain efforts to get back to China—to the mighty,
majestic Spirit of the Mountain and River, whose love
they have lost. Look in that top berth and tell me what
you see there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s empty,” I said.</p>

<p>“Look again,” he replied.</p>

<p>I did so, but still there was nothing there, only just
the bare, dingy panelling.</p>

<p>“Well,” he asked, “what now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I said; “absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“Go up to it and put one hand inside,” he remarked.</p>

<p>I did so, and sprang back with a loud cry. I had
touched a face!</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, as I stepped out into the semi-darkness
of the causeway, “it frightens some people, but it never
frightens me, because I know that the only consolation
possible for these unhappy spirits is to lie next to, or to
come in contact with, the bodies of those whose spirits
are walking and talking with their fond ones in distant
China.”</p>

<p>Whilst I was at York Road I became acquainted with
an Irish doctor, whom I will call Flynn. He ran a surgery
not far from King Ho’s house. Flynn belonged to a
famous secret society, whose fundamental object was to
carry on a doctrine of surreptitious hatred to England and
all things English. Though I had no sympathy with such
a society—for I have always held the opinion that, however
badly England behaved to Ireland in the past, the
majority of the English people of to-day are only too
anxious to act fairly to her, and therefore it is better to let
bygones be bygones—I found Flynn a very original and
entertaining character. All his patients were either Irish
or of foreign extraction, and whenever any English person
came to the surgery, he flatly refused to attend them.</p>

<p>One evening, when I was sitting chatting with him in
front of a blazing peat fire—Flynn would never burn
English coal—two Swedish engineers came into the
surgery, and Flynn, who, for some peculiar reason, was
particularly partial to the Swedes, asked them to join us
at supper. The meal certainly was not in the approved
style of the West End, nor, perhaps, would it have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
appealed to the nouveau riche; for there was no snowy
tablecloth, no serviettes, no champagne, no liqueurs; it
consisted of boiled beef, suet dumplings, potatoes—boiled
in their skins, of course—and plenty, yes, plenty,
of stout and whiskey; and it was very welcome to the
four hungry, healthy men, who did ample justice to it.
After we had finished, and pipes were produced, I
brought up the subject of ghosts—never very far from
my mind—and one of the Swedes laughed.</p>

<p>“Ghosts,” he said, “there are no such things. Neither
ghosts nor fairies. I believe in nothing. There is no
God, no devil, no heaven, no hell. When we die, we
die—there is no future life whatever.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a séance,” Flynn said, “and see if we
can’t convince him. I have the skeleton of a murderer
in the room overhead. I will fetch it down, and it shall
sit round the table with us.”</p>

<p>“All right!” the sceptical Swede, whose name was
Nielssen, said. “Fetch it down; fetch twenty skeletons
you like, the more the merrier. Nothing will convince me.”</p>

<p>Flynn ran upstairs, and presently reappeared with a
tall skeleton in his arms. The table was cleared, and we
all sat round it with our hands spread out after the usual
manner of table turners, the skeleton being placed
between the two Swedes, each of whom had hold of one of
its hands. Flynn then turned down the lights, and we
started asking the table questions, many of which, I fear,
were of a very ribald and frivolous nature. Every now
and then it gave a big tilt, and Nielssen shouted, “That’s
for me! It’s my mother-in-law—she’s found out I’ve
been making love to my landlady’s daughter.” Once
there was a rap, and for the moment I was taken in.
Then the other Swede, Heilborn, cried out, “It’s only
Nielssen. He did it with his foot; he’s incorrigible!”
This sort of thing went on for some time, Flynn and
Nielssen constantly playing some prank, and Heilborn
and myself not always too serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the atmosphere of the room seemed to undergo
a change, and, as if by common consent, we were all
silent. Then Nielssen uttered a sharp cry of pain.</p>

<p>“Strike a light quickly,” he cried; “my hand is
being hurt frightfully!”</p>

<p>We did so, and Nielssen gave vent to an expression of
relief.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” Heilborn asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Nielssen said faintly. He was
evidently much shaken, and spoke with the emotion of a
man who has undergone some violent shock. “I was
only holding the skeleton the same as you, when I suddenly
felt its fingers close like a vice on mine. It was a
grip of iron. See, my hand is crushed almost out of
shape!” He held it out, and we all bent over it
curiously. Compared with the other hand, it looked
singularly white and limp, and when Flynn touched
it, Nielssen very perceptibly winced.</p>

<p>Flynn gave him some brandy, and after a little while
he seemed himself again; but he would not continue
the séance. “There’s something very odd about the
skeleton,” he said. “I don’t believe in spirits, as you
know, but there must be something closely akin to one
attached to this thing,” and he gave it a vicious kick
with his foot.</p>

<p>A week later, when I called at Flynn’s house, he told
me that Nielssen was in bed. He had fallen downstairs
and badly bruised his spine, besides breaking a leg.
“He’ll get over it all right,” Flynn said, “but it will be
some time before he can do anything. His account of the
accident is most remarkable; in fact, he declares that it
wasn’t an accident, that he was deliberately thrown. He
swears that he distinctly saw a skeleton hand suddenly
catch hold of him round the ankle, and that the next
moment he felt himself whirling through the air. He is
most emphatic in his declaration that he will never again
scoff at ghosts or play with the invisible. And now,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Flynn added, “the wretched thing has begun to plague
me. I can’t get a decent night’s sleep. As soon as I
begin to doze I am visited by the most disturbing
dreams. I invariably hear knocking at the door, and
when I open it, something rushes in and strangles me.
But the worst of it is, I hear the knocking when I’m
awake, too. Sometimes it begins directly I get into bed,
before my head has touched the pillow. Knock, knock,
knock!—the hard, sharp knock of bony knuckles on
door, walls and furniture. I am not actually frightened,
but I don’t like it. What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“If it’s not the skeleton, the spirit of some depraved
human,” I replied, “it’s some other equally low and
vicious earth-bound, one of the class that visit séances
and attach themselves to the unlucky sitter. You might
try getting rid of the skeleton—have it cremated and
see what effect that has.”</p>

<p>Flynn took my advice; the skeleton was reduced to
ashes, and the ashes buried many miles away from
Limehouse Causeway, after which, the disturbances, as
far as Flynn was concerned, at any rate, entirely ceased.
Whether Nielssen was victimised again I cannot say. He
rejoined his ship as soon as he had recovered, and since
then he has completely passed out of my existence.</p>

<p>There was a house I used occasionally to go to in
Whitechapel, a rendezvous of itinerant free lance writers
like myself, where, although I never actually saw any
ghostly phenomena, I always had very extraordinary
impressions. The moment I crossed the threshold, I
fancied I was in a big funeral procession following a
hearse. It was a dull, winter’s day, I thought; there were
inches of slush on the ground, and the cold was intense.
I could not see the faces of the people walking beside me,
but I instinctively knew that they wore an expression of
extreme relief, and that some even of them should-be
mourners laughed. We tramped on till we came to a
steep hill, then there was a loud report, and at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
everything became chaotic. After this my mind gradually
cleared and the impressions abruptly ceased. There
was no variation in these impressions, they always began
and ended in precisely the same way; moreover, I
invariably received them whenever I entered the house.
I mentioned my experience one day to an habitué of the
place, and he quite casually informed me that several
men who went there had had similar experiences, and he
thought the landlord, if approached tactfully, might offer
some sort of explanation. Acting upon this suggestion, I
spoke to the landlord, and learned from him that half a
century or more ago the house was owned by a wealthy
tradesman, who, it was generally supposed, had made his
money by sweating his employés. When he died, all the
hands had to attend his funeral, but far from looking sad,
as they followed the coffin, they had exhibited every
manifestation of joy. Just as the procession had reached
the summit of a steep hill, a half-witted man fired a gun
from a cottage window, and the horses drawing the
hearse, taking fright, dashed down the incline and into a
wall at the foot of it. Strange to say, no one was injured,
but the coffin was thrown out and broken to pieces. The
event made a great impression upon the minds of all who
witnessed it, and the landlord informed me that I was
by no means the only person who, upon entering the
house, had received a vivid mental picture of the
scene.</p>

<p>I am often asked if I am a consistent medium. No, I
am not. It is only at times I see ghosts, only at times I
receive vivid impressions, and I do not believe that any
person, however mediumistic, can depend upon his or her
psychic faculty for consistency. I have been to several
public séances, where professional mediums have had the
audacity to say they see spirits standing beside practically
everyone in the assembly. They rattle off the
description of an alleged spirit, as if it were a part in a
well-rehearsed play—and play it undoubtedly is to anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
who pauses to reflect. Genuine phantasms do not
come to order quite so readily.</p>

<p>In olden times, when people were really psychic, those
versed in the art from their childhood upwards could only
raise a ghost with great difficulty, and often, only by
resorting to spells, many of which were of a very subtle
and complex nature. And when, in the end, they did
succeed, such manifestations invariably had a very
alarming effect on the medium as well as the spectator.
How is it, then, that so many of the professional mediums
of to-day can not only see visitants from the other world,
whenever they like, all around them, but can view these
ghostly visitants without being in the least disconcerted,
without—as the saying is—turning a hair? Have
they really stronger nerves than had Saul, and a closer,
far closer intimacy with the Unknown than had the
Witch of Endor, or can it be that the Spirit World has
so participated in our age of quickness—our rapid forms
of locomotion—that a medium has only to raise his or
her eyebrows and a host of spirits at once whiz into the
room? I do not think so. I believe that such mediums—the
mediums whose psychic vision is apparently
inexhaustible, and can be turned on and off to order—are
either unmitigated humbugs or hysterical dupes,
who mistake the baldest impressions for actual spiritual
phenomena.</p>

<p>The unmitigated humbug has only to describe the
alleged presence with a little elasticity, and the description
will surely fit—albeit somewhat loosely—one or
another of our departed friends. Who amongst us does
not know someone on the other side passably good-looking,
rather tall, of medium colouring, and somewhat
stout? And if we plead that we do not, it is of no consequence—the
medium glibly asserts that the spirit he or
she describes has got behind our chair by mistake, and is
really searching for someone else. But apart from this
obvious fraud, can we believe that any one of those whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
we have loved and lost would so degrade themselves and
us as to appear at a public séance before a company of
strangers. Surely we would rather not see them at all,
than see them in such circumstances. At any rate, we
would rather—much rather—possess our souls in
patience, until our departed loved ones can appear to us
in private—as they sometimes can—without the intervention
of any medium whatsoever.</p>

<p>With regard to automatic or spirit writing, there is, I
believe, just as much fraud practised. The mere fact that
Sir somebody or other has a touching belief in one or two
of these automatic scribes is quite enough for most
people, and, consequently, they never dream of questioning
the integrity of any medium who professes to convey
to them messages from the dead. It is sufficient that the
man with the title, the great man of science, believes.
But they forget, often wilfully forget, that the cleverest
man is often the most simple; that a great judge has not
unfrequently had his pockets picked; and that eminence
in one direction by no means denotes ability in another.</p>

<p>Snobbishness is responsible for much. The big man is
credulous, and because he is credulous the little man is
credulous too. Hence, consistency in the spirit world, in
clairvoyance, in automatic writing, is, for the moment,
almost universally accepted, and direct communication
with the spirit world erroneously looked upon as an
every-day occurrence. It will be otherwise when the
man in the street wakes up and discovers the occult for
himself. Experience will, I think, teach him, as it has
taught me, that although ghosts may on very rare
occasions come to order—and when they do, their coming
is, I believe, quite as surprising to the medium as it is to
the audience—by far the greater number of superphysical
phenomena appear spontaneously; and it is through
such spontaneous appearances only that we can hope to
make any progress in our communication with the other
world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subt">NIGHT RAMBLINGS ON WIMBLEDON COMMON AND
HOUNSLOW HEATH</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">If</span> there are any places in London that should be more
haunted than others, assuredly those places are the
parks and commons. When I was living on the south
side of the river, I spent many nights tramping about
Wimbledon, Clapham, Wandsworth, Tooting and
Streatham Commons. Since then I have lived at Blackheath,
Hampstead, Hounslow and Dulwich, so that I
may say I know pretty nearly every inch of these places.
I can see myself now standing on Wimbledon Common
close to a pool, in the dead of night. No one about, and
the reflection of the moon staring at me from the
unruffled surface of the water. I am trying to get
impressions of any event that may have taken place
there. I got none. Suddenly a hand falls on my
shoulder; I swing round, and peering into my face is
the white, haggard face of a tramp.</p>

<p>“You ain’t going to drown yourself, are you?” he
said.</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked, anticipating a severe rebuke from
this withered and worn scarecrow of humanity.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “because don’t do it here! I can
show you a much better spot, where the water is deep,
and where, when once you get in, you can’t very easily
get out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“But how will that benefit you?” I enquired, wondering
why he was so eager.</p>

<p>“You can let me have your clothes, can’t you?” he
explained; “you won’t want to take them with you into
the next world. From what I hears about it, sperrits
don’t need neither coats nor trousers, and the few
shillings I shall get for them will do me a bit of good,
and won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t contemplating suicide,” I remarked.
“I’m not tired of life yet.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you,” he said, in extremely disappointed tones.
“Then why are you out here at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“If it comes to that,” I observed, “why are you?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nowhere else to go,” he said; “and there
are no police out here to disturb anyone.”</p>

<p>“Nor ghosts?” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Ghosts!” he chuckled. “I’m not afraid of ghosts.
I shall soon be one myself, I expect; but there is one
spot here I don’t go near after dark.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why,” he said. “Come along with me, and maybe
you’ll guess.”</p>

<p>Had he been anything like my size I should not have
gone, for his appearance was very far from assuring, but,
as he was a small man, I felt comparatively safe. We
walked side by side over the grass, crossed a gleaming,
white path, and steering in a slightly northerly direction—I
could tell that much by the stars—abruptly halted in
front of a shallow pit, on the other side of which was a
big bush.</p>

<p>“It’s there,” he said, pointing at the pit. “I’ve tried
to sleep there twice, and each time I’ve been woken up
by hearing something heavy fall close to my head. It
seems to come from the bush. It’s the bush that skeers
me,” he added, “and though I don’t mind passing it
in the day-time, nothing on earth will persuade me to
look behind it after dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not even sixpence,” I said, fingering that coin in my
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he said, “you haven’t sixpence, otherwise
you’d not be here. You’re joking. If anyone really did
offer me sixpence now to do it, well, I don’t say but what
I mightn’t try.”</p>

<p>He spoke so hungrily and looked so famished that I
decided to part with it, though sixpence to me just then
had a particularly real value. I showed it him. “Look
behind that tree,” I said, “and I’ll give it you.”</p>

<p>He set off at once. “No,” I called out, “that won’t
do; you must go through the pit.” He proceeded to
obey, and was in the middle of the hollow, when I distinctly
heard something very heavy strike the ground
apparently close to him. I ran round the bush, just in
time to see what I thought was a black shadow shoot
across the ground and disappear in a neighbouring cluster
of trees. When I returned, the tramp was still in the pit,
but I could see nothing there to account for the noise.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said. “Did you hear it?”</p>

<p>“I heard something,” I replied, “and there’s your
sixpence.”</p>

<p>I often went to Wimbledon Common afterwards, but
never again saw the tramp, nor found the hollow.</p>

<p>My Blackheath and Greenwich Park experiences, or at
least most of them, are narrated fully in my “Haunted
Houses of London,” so that I can only refer briefly to
them here.</p>

<p>From the impressions I got, when walking on the
Common at Blackheath, I shall always believe that the
superphysical influences there are particularly demoralising.
It always seemed to me that Blackheath—by the
way a curiously appropriate name—might be the rendezvous
of the very worst type of earth-bound phantasms of
the dead, and of the most vicious neutrarians.</p>

<p>After leaving London and entering on my scholastic
career, I was first of all a master at Daventry, then tutor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in an Irish family at Aldershot, and then, in succession, a
master in preparatory schools at Wandsworth, Hereford
and Blackheath. Of these various posts, I liked that at
Blackheath the least, partly because the headmaster
there was the most unmitigated snob, and my pupils
hopelessly spoilt, and partly because I had such a
detestation of the heath after dark.</p>

<p>My only consolation in those days was cricket and
writing. Every evening, after my work with the boys
was done, I repaired to a room over a library in Blackheath
village, and it was there that I completed my first
novel, “For Satan’s Sake.”</p>

<p>The book deals with the soul of a suicide, and was
based, as I have already stated, on my experiences in
America and York Road, Lambeth. I tried it with
various publishers, but without success, and it was not
until six years later, when I was living in a small fishing
town in Cornwall, that I eventually got it taken. It so
happened that a well-known novelist came to see me one
day, and when I told him that I had attempted a book,
he said he would like to see it. I fished it out of the box,
where it had lain undisturbed for years, and he went off
with it, subsequently showing it to a reader of a publishing
firm—also a well-known novelist—who was staying
in the town at the time, and who was so impressed with
it, that he advised his firm to accept it. It did not even
then come out for over a year, and the anxiety of awaiting
my début as an author can better be imagined than
described. The success I prayed for was not showered
upon me, but the book was well received on the whole,
and paved the way for other works to follow.</p>

<p>And now, let me hie back to London and its commons.
Though Hampstead has, in all probability, its share of
phantasms, my impressions there have been of a more
agreeable nature than at Blackheath. I spent the greater
part of several consecutive nights one summer sitting on
a bench in a very rustic glade on the heath, waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
anything that might happen. Once or twice between one
and two something seemed to be making a violent effort
to materialise, and I fully expected to see a figure suddenly
appear before me. My impressions were that it
would be the figure of a woman, and that she would be
carrying a white bundle in her arms. I felt that she was
in great trouble and wanted to ask me for advice. I
associated her worries with a big house that used to stand
somewhere near the summit of Hampstead Hill. I felt all
this very acutely, and I used to repeat aloud my willingness
to do anything I could to assist her.</p>

<p>Strange to say, a few years later, I met a lady who told
me that she had had a curious experience in the same
spot. She was walking through it rather late one autumn
evening, accompanied by her dog, a big black retriever.
When she came to the seat where I used to sit, the dog
started barking and showed signs of great terror. Somewhat
alarmed, she was about to hurry on, when a voice
close to her said, “It’s only me, Winifred; don’t be
frightened. The boat I sailed in to America was wrecked,
and only the child was saved.”</p>

<p>The lady looked round, but there was no one in sight.
On reaching home, she mentioned the incident to her
mother, who exclaimed in astonishment, “Well, that is
odd! I was sitting on a seat, I should think in that very
spot, about forty years ago—we were living in D——
House, on Haverstock Hill, at the time—when a letter
was brought me announcing the loss of a big sailing
vessel in the Atlantic, on which my maid, Winnie, as we
used to call her, had sailed with her husband to America.
Only a very few of the passengers and crew survived, and
Winnie and her husband were both drowned. But I
never knew they had a child.”</p>

<p>Hounslow Heath should teem with ghosts, for it once
swarmed with foot-pads, who, after committing every
conceivable act of violence on and around the heath,
usually ended their career there on gibbets. I once had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
rooms near the Bath Road, and spent many nights
rambling about the Heath in quest of ghostly adventure.
One evening I kept fancying I was followed everywhere
by a tall, muffled figure, and when, in alarm, I hastened
over the grass on to the roadway, I heard a low, cynical
laugh. All the way home the steps seemed to pursue me,
and when I got into bed and prepared to blow out the
light, I saw the curtains by the window rustle and swell
out, as if someone was behind them. It was a long time
before I ventured to blow out the light, and, when I slept,
I dreamed a dark, hooded figure was bending over me.</p>

<p>On another occasion, as I perambulated the heath,
where the trees were thickly clustered and the undergrowth
had become the densest tangle, I caught a glimpse
of two men playing dice. I heard their laughter and the
rattling of the box, as they shook it in the air and threw
out the dice. Then suddenly their gaiety was turned to
wrath—there were oaths and blows, cries and groans, and
all became silent, save for the soughing and moaning of
the wind through the lofty tree-tops. But as I came
away from the heath, there was again that cynical laugh,
and again footsteps seemed to follow me home, and again
the curtain by the window of my room shook and swelled.</p>

<p>I did not go to the heath one night; I lay awake in bed
instead, and about the hour I had usually returned I
heard steps, long, swinging steps coming down the little
side road towards the house. My memory at once went
back to that night in Dublin, and I strained my ears to
catch the accompanying sound. I had not long to wait—it
soon came, the same old familiar click, click, click! In
an agony of fear, lest the steps should stop at the house
and there should be a repetition of the terrible knocking
at the door, I lighted a candle and sat up. Nearer and
nearer they came, and then, when I felt certain they
would stop, to my infinite relief they went on. On past
the house, the echoes ringing out loud and clear in the
keen, frosty air, until they reached the Bath Road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>I fully expected some misfortune would happen to me
after this occurrence, as the last time I had heard the
steps had been at the time of my failure to pass the
medical for the R.I.C., and shortly before my disastrous
trip to America. Yet nothing of a specially untoward
nature happened. Apparently, the steps on this occasion
merely heralded another change in my vocation, for I
shortly afterwards became imbued with the desire to be
an actor, and commenced what was destined to be a
lively, though very brief theatrical career, as a pupil in
the Henry Neville Studio, Oxford Street.</p>

<p>Before, however, passing on to subsequent events, I
must relate one other—the only other—ghostly happening
I experienced at Hounslow. In a remote corner of
the heath there was one spot that had a peculiar fascination
for me, and, whenever I returned from it, I dreamed
the same dream—that a beautiful girl in an old-world
costume, with fair hair, large, blue eyes and daintily-moulded
lips, approached my bed and leaned over me.
She had the most appealing expression in her face, and
seemed to be anxious to make me her confidant. I was
always about to address her, when some extraordinary
metamorphosis took place, and I awoke, palpitating
with terror.</p>

<p>The dream greatly impressed me, and I tried my best
to discover a reason for it. I did eventually, but not until
the year I published “Some Haunted Houses of England
and Wales,” when I got into correspondence with a very
old lady, whom I will call Miss Carmichael. Miss Carmichael
lived at Ealing, close to the Parish Church, and
wrote to me to the effect that, if I liked to call on her, she
could tell me a curious tale about an old house that used
to stand on the outskirts of Hounslow Heath. Of course
I accepted this invitation.</p>

<p>I found Miss Carmichael, when I called, lying on
a sofa, crippled with rheumatism, but otherwise in
the full possession of all her senses, and wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
vivacious, despite the fact that she was well over
ninety.</p>

<p>“The house I want to tell you about,” she said, “was
called ‘The Gables.’ It was a large, old-fashioned manor
house with very extensive grounds, and at the beginning
of the last century it belonged to my aged relative, Miss
Denning. She never lived in it herself, but she kept it in
excellent repair, and at her death, in or about 1820, her
nephew inherited an apparently valuable property. Now,
Tom Denning had a great friend, Dick Mayhew, and it
was from Dick Mayhew, who was also a great friend of
mine, that I heard the most detailed account of the
hauntings. I will try and tell you the story just as my
friend told it to me.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>“I was sitting in my stuffy office in Jermyn Street one
spring morning, when, who should suddenly walk in but
Tom Denning, whom I had not seen for some time.
‘Why, Dick,’ he said, ‘how fagged and run down you
look. A spell in the country is what you need, it would do
you all the good in the world. Supposing you come down
to my place at Hounslow, and have a blow on the Heath.
I keep a couple of horses, and you can ride all day if you
like.’</p>

<p>“What surprises you spring on one,” I ejaculated.
“I didn’t know you were living so near London—and at
Hounslow, too! Aren’t you afraid of highwaymen. I
hear they still visit the place occasionally. How long
have you been there?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been there yet,” Dick replied with a
laugh; “at least, not to stay. The property has just
been left me by my aunt. It’s a queer old house, just the
kind of place a romantic beggar like you would like, and
if any house ought to be haunted, it ought. They say a
murder was once committed there by an ancestress of
mine, a girl whose face was as beautiful as she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was evil, and that her spirit still roams the house and
grounds.”</p>

<p>“I should certainly like to see her,” I said, “and so,
I am sure, would Greg.” (Greg was Dick’s bloodhound).</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give you both an opportunity,” Tom
laughed. “Take Greg with you, and a friend too, if you
like, for I may not be able to join you at once.”</p>

<p>“I accepted, and in due course arrived at ‘The
Gables,’ accompanied by my cousin Ralph, who was then
a Lieutenant in the Buffs, and Greg.</p>

<p>“The grounds surrounding ‘The Gables,’ which stood
near the edge of the heath, were encompassed by a very
high, red-brick wall, and consisted of a broad, well-kept
lawn in front, a small spinney on one side, an extensive
shrubbery on the other, and big kitchen gardens at the
back. The house itself, seventeenth century and covered
with ivy from tip to toe, was picturesque in the extreme.
There were no servants, only the caretakers, a middle-aged
man and his wife, who occupied rooms in the east
wing. The west wing was reserved for us.</p>

<p>“After dinner, in a hall so enormous that it made us
feel positively lilliputian, we wandered out into the
garden. It was a glorious night, the sky one mass of
silver, scintillating stars, the air redolent with the odour
of spring flowers. ‘By Jove,’ Ralph remarked to me, as
we strolled across the lawn, ‘By Jove! No one would
think we were so close to that God-forsaken heath; why,
it was only a few years ago that a fellow in my regiment
was set on there, and, after being robbed of all he had on
him, half beaten to death with bludgeons. It’s one of the
worst cut-throat spots round London.’ Then he uttered
an exclamation of surprise and jogged my elbow.</p>

<p>“Coming towards us from the house was the figure of
a young girl. She wore a white dress with a dark cloak
flung loosely over her shoulders, and the moonlight playing
over her face revealed a countenance of extraordinary
delicacy and beauty. Her eyes were large and childlike
in their expression, her lips daintily modelled, her teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
wonderfully white and even, her hair golden. Whether
it was the effect of the moonlight on them or not, I cannot
say, but her cheeks were absolutely devoid of colour,
almost strikingly pale, whilst I fancied I detected in the
slightly open mouth an expression of pain. I saw every
detail most distinctly, even to the shape of her fingers,
which were very pointed. She came on without apparently
noticing us, and we watched her trip past us and
disappear in the spinney.</p>

<p>“‘What a stunner!’ Ralph exclaimed. ‘I don’t
know when I’ve seen a prettier face! Sly fellow,
Denning! I wonder who she can be!’ He had hardly
finished speaking when we heard the most awful scream,
a shriek of terror and despair, such as sent all the blood
in my body to my heart, and left the rest of me like ice.</p>

<p>“‘My God! What’s happened to her?’ Ralph
gasped. ‘She’s being murdered. Quick!’ We dashed
into the spinney, but despite the fact that we searched
everywhere, no girl was to be found.</p>

<p>“Returning to the house, we made enquiries of the
caretakers, who were vehement in their denial of knowing
the girl or of having heard her cries. Much puzzled, we
then retired to our night quarters. The room that had
been assigned to us, for we preferred to share one between
us, was situated about midway down a long, narrow
corridor, lighted at the further end by a casement
window, across which sprays of ivy blew to and fro in
the cool breeze.</p>

<p>“For a long time we sat in front of the fire chatting,
but at one o’clock Ralph got up, and exclaimed that it
was high time we turned into bed.</p>

<p>“‘Hullo, look at Greg!’ he said, pointing to the dog,
who was crouching on the floor in front of the door
showing its teeth in a series of savage growls. ‘What’s
the matter with him?’</p>

<p>“Before I had time to reply, we suddenly heard a
regular, measured tap, tap, tap, as of high-heeled shoes,
coming along the corridor towards our door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘That can’t be either the caretaker or his wife,’
Ralph whispered. ‘I wonder if it’s the young lady!
Perhaps she’s going to pay us a surreptitious visit. I
only wish she would—the little darling!’</p>

<p>“Nearer and nearer came the steps, until they seemed
to stop just outside our door. Greg’s hair bristled, he
gave a deep growl, and retreated half way across the
room. Then there came a loud knock on the door,
followed by the sound of a violent scuffle. Springing
forward, Ralph threw the door wide open. There was
nothing there, only the cold light of the moon, and the
white, motionless faces of the Dennings’ ancestors
hanging on the walls.</p>

<p>“‘It’s deuced odd,’ Ralph said. ‘I swear I heard
steps and a knock, and yet there’s nothing to account for
it. Could it have been rats?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t think so,’ I said; ‘rats wouldn’t have
frightened Greg. Look at him now; he has quite recovered.’
Greg had come to my side and was licking my
hand and wagging his tail.</p>

<p>“In the morning I asked the caretaker’s wife if the
place was haunted.</p>

<p>“‘Haunted,’ she stammered. ‘No. Whatever made
you think of such a thing, sir! There ain’t no such
things as ghosts. It’s them howls you ’eard.’</p>

<p>“Seeing there was nothing to be got out of her, Ralph
and I did not refer to the subject again, but spent our
time reading in the library, and wandering about the
heath.</p>

<p>“In the evening we sauntered out into the garden and
tried to coax Greg to come with us, but he resolutely
refused, and so we had to leave him behind. Just about
the same time as on the previous evening, and in identically
the same place, we again saw the girl.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll speak to her, hanged if I don’t,’ Ralph muttered,
and taking off his hat, he stepped forward and accosted
her. Without apparently perceiving us, she passed
resolutely on, and, entering the spinney, was speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
lost to sight. Almost directly afterwards, the same
awful, wailing scream rose shrill and high on the still
night air. This time we did not rush after her, but,
walking hurriedly back to the house, we sought the companionship
of the bright and cheery fireside.</p>

<p>“At one o’clock we were again seated in our bedroom,
and the events of the preceding night were repeated in
every detail.</p>

<p>“On the morrow Tom joined us. When we told him
of the ghost, he became intensely interested.</p>

<p>“‘It must be my ancestress,’ he said. ‘The girl who
was supposed to have murdered somebody. I’ll sit
up with you two fellows to-night and we’ll have the
door open.’</p>

<p>“After dinner we all three went into the garden.</p>

<p>“‘It’s here we first caught sight of her,’ Ralph exclaimed,
as we halted on the lawn, ‘here, and precisely at
this hour. Yes—by Jove!—and there she is!’</p>

<p>“I looked, and there was the figure I knew so well,
tripping daintily towards us, her yellow hair and silver
shoe buckles gleaming furiously in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“‘She wears a hood,’ Tom cried, ‘and it completely
hides her face.’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ Ralph retorted; ‘she has no hood, you
must be dreaming.’</p>

<p>“As before, the girl passed us and we lost sight of her
amongst the trees. The next moment, and we again
heard her scream. Then we searched everywhere, but
with no result. She was certainly not on the premises,
and as there was no avenue of escape save by scaling a
ten foot wall, we could only conclude she had melted into
fine air, in other words—vanished.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll get to the bottom of this mystery,’ Tom growled
between his teeth, ‘if I root up every tree in the garden.’</p>

<p>“‘What you’ve seen so far,’ Ralph observed, ‘is only
the prelude. There’s more to come, and I’m not sure if
Act II. is not the most exciting. What do you think,
Dick?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Ask Greg,’ I replied. ‘I believe he knows more
about it than we do.’</p>

<p>“On arriving indoors, we all three retired to the
bedroom we had agreed to share. The night was so
exquisite that I sat by the open window. Directly
beneath me was the gravel drive, which lay like a broad,
white belt encircling the house, and beyond it, on the
level sweep of lawn, danced the shadows from the larch
and fir trees in the paddock; the only sign of life came
from the bats and night birds that wheeled and skimmed
in silent flight in and out the bushes. There was very
little breeze, sufficient only to make the ivy rustle and the
window in the corridor outside give the faintest perceptible
jar. I gazed at my companions. Ralph lay on
the sofa, sound asleep, a half-serious, half-amused look
on his handsome features, while Tom sat in an armchair
directly in front of the fire, his head buried in the palms
of his hands, as if wrapt in profound thought. A distant
church clock boomed one. Greg growled, and Tom, at
once springing up, flung the door widely back on its
hinges. ‘There,’ he said. ‘Come what may, we’re
ready for it.’ As he concluded, there came a tapping.</p>

<p>“Tap, tap, tap; someone in high-heeled shoes was
walking over the polished oak boards of the corridor in
our direction. To me there was a world of stealth and
cautiousness in the sounds, that suggested a host of
conflicting motives. As the steps drew nearer, the door
suddenly swung to with a loud crash, and before we had
time to recover from our astonishment, someone rapped.
With a shout of baffled rage, Tom leaped to his feet and
tore at the handle. The massive door at once flew open.
The corridor was empty—only moonbeams and pictures—nothing
more.</p>

<p>“The following day was wet, and we stayed indoors,
all the morning and afternoon, reading. As it cleared up
a little towards supper-time, Tom proposed going for a
short walk. We slipped on our overcoats, and were
crossing the big entrance hall to the front door, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Tom suddenly exclaimed, ‘Hang it! I’ve left my pipe
upstairs. I say, wait a minute, you fellows, till I get it.’
He started running, and then stopped short, giving vent
to a loud exclamation. Ascending the broad staircase in
front of us was a form, whose back view exactly resembled
that of the golden-haired beauty we had seen in the
garden. Where she had sprung from we could not say.
We only knew she was there.</p>

<p>“‘By Jove! I’ll see her face this time,’ Tom said.
‘I’ll see it, even if I have to force her to turn round.’ He
ran after her, and, mounting the stairs two at a time,
stretched out his hand to pluck at her sleeve. She
turned, and her face was to us a blank. What Tom saw
we never knew. Shouting, ‘Take the damned thing
away from me!’ he stepped back and fell; and when we
ran forward, we found him lying at the foot of the stairs—dead.”</p>

<p>The property, Miss Carmichael informed me, passed to
a distant relative, who, after trying in vain to let it,
pulled it down. The ghost, it was rumoured, was that of
a very beautiful ancestress of the Dennings, who, after
leading a life, evil even for those times, disappeared.
What happened to her material body no one ever knew,
but her spirit was supposed to haunt the house and
grounds in dual form. To the stranger, that is to say,
to those outside her own family, she appeared in all the
radiant beauty of her earthly body, but to the Dennings
she seldom revealed her face. When she did, they beheld
something too terrible for the mind to conceive—and live.</p>

<p>“I have heard,” Miss Carmichael added, “that the
ghost has been seen quite recently haunting the site once
occupied by the house and grounds, and also the borders
of the heath.”</p>

<p>And as Miss Carmichael was very emphatic on this last
point, I may not unreasonably conclude that the girl of
my dreams was the actual ghost of “The Gables.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="subt">MY VIEWS ON A FUTURE LIFE FOR THE ANIMAL AND
VEGETABLE WORLDS</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">I mentioned</span> in one of my former works that I believe
many of the figures we pass by in the streets are not men
and women like ourselves, but phantasms—phantasms
of the living, that is to say, spirit projections of people
consciously or unconsciously thinking of being where we
see them—phantasms of the dead, and impersonating
neutrarians.</p>

<p>Mingling with the crowds in the parks and gliding in
and out the trees, I have often seen people with the
pallor of corpses; I have followed them, and they have
unaccountably vanished. I believe Hyde Park, particularly
the northern side, to be as full of ghosts as any
spot in London, and I have heard many strange tales
from the outcasts, the tattered and torn brigade, who
have slept all night under its trees and bushes. The
police are, I believe, expected to clear the Park before
locking-up time, and I’ve no doubt they try to do so,
but they cannot possibly look into every nook and
cranny in that vast expanse, and there are many in which
one could easily hide and defy detection. I have tried
the experiment once, and I am not anxious to try it
again; there is no place so terribly depressing, so
strangely suggestive of suicide, and hauntings by the
most grotesque type of neutrarians, as London’s premier
park by night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Some twelve or fifteen years ago, in my nightly
rambles there, I noticed that the seat beneath a certain
tree, mid-way between the Marble Arch and Lancaster
Gate, was rarely occupied, whereas all the other seats in
that vicinity were invaded by couples. One evening, the
weather being warm and sultry, I went and sat there.
I dozed off, and eventually fell into a deep sleep. I
dreamed that an old man and a young girl stood under
the tree, whispering, and that as I watched them they
raised their eyes, and looked in a horribly guilty manner,
not at me, but at the space next me, which I perceived,
for the first time, was occupied by a tiny child. Moving
stealthily forward and holding in their hands an outspread
cloth, they crept up behind the child, the cloth
descended, and all three vanished. Then something
made me gaze up into the branches of the tree, and I saw
a large, light, colourless, heavily-lidded eye peering down
at me with an expression of the utmost malevolence. It
was altogether so baneful, so symbolic of cruelty, malice,
and hate that I could only stare back at it in mute
astonishment. The whole shape of the tree then seemed
to alter, and to become like an enormous dark hand,
which, swaying violently to and fro, suddenly dived down
and closed over me. I awoke at once, but was so afraid
of seeing the eye, that for some minutes I kept my own
eyes tightly shut. When I opened them, I saw, bending
over me, a very white face, and to my intense relief a
voice, unmistakably human, croaked, “No wonder
you’re scared, sitting here at this time of night by yourself.”</p>

<p>The speaker was merely one of the many hundreds of
tramps for whom the Park was reception and bedroom
combined. His hat was little more than a rim, and his
trousers cried shame on the ladies I saw every day with
their skirts plastered all over with buttons. His cheeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were hollow, his eyes preternaturally bright, and his
breath full of hunger. Still, he was alive, and anything
alive just then was very welcome.</p>

<p>“I never sleep here,” he said; “none of us do.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because it’s haunted,” he said. “You may laugh—so
did I years ago, afore I took to this sort of thing. But
sleeping out-of-doors all night has taught me more than
any politicians, bishops, or schoolmasters know; or any
of those fine ladies that swell about in their carriages
know; I’ve seen sights that would make an hangel
afraid; I’ve seen ghosts of all sorts. They’re not all like
us, neither. Some of them ain’t human at all, they’re
devils. You may laugh when you read about them in
them library books, but it’s no laughing matter when you
see them, as I’ve seen them, all alone and cold, in some
wayside ditch. This tree, I tell yer, is ’aunted—and it’s a
devil that ’aunts it. Ask my mates, any of them that
you’ll find sleeping in the parks. There’s many of them
that ’ave experienced it. They’ve seen something hiding
in the branches, and when they’ve seen it, they’ve felt
they must either kill themselves or someone else. There’s
a devil in the tree that tempts one to do all kind of
wicked things, and if you take my advice, young man,
you’ll sit somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“I think I will,” I said; “and here’s something for
your warning.” I gave him threepence, the only coins I
had on me just then, and, overwhelming me with thanks,
he shuffled away.</p>

<p>Since that night I have often thought that the poor—the
very poor—know far more of the other world or
worlds than do the rich, and that they know more—far
more—on other points than the rich. The statesman
talks of the people and the people’s needs, but what does
he know of the people and their needs? He rarely, if
ever, goes amongst them. Except in electioneering
times, I doubt if any Member of Parliament ever goes
into the more squalid of our London districts. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
seen one Member of the House of Lords eating whelks in
a tavern in the Limehouse Causeway, but he is an exception.
Journalists go there—but the leisured folk—never.</p>

<p>It bores them; and yet how much they might learn,
how much not only of urgent human needs, but of coming
storms. They might learn that the East End brews
whilst the West End sleeps, and that as surely as the
long-talked-of German war cloud—that war cloud they
affected to ridicule—has at last burst, so undoubtedly
will the war cloud of revolution; revolution hatched by
malcontents of all nationalities in East End doss houses
and crowded coffee taverns.</p>

<p>This is no empty prophecy. The cinders of the volcano
have been hot for some time—they are now burning hot—and
the hour is fast approaching when they will arise
mightily in a red conflagration. Are we prepared for it?
It takes a very sound constitution to face a revolution
with perfect confidence. Are we sound? Can any
constitution be sound when the rich daily grow richer,
and the poor, poorer. Where Art—all that cries out for
beauty, real beauty, beauty as it is seen and worshipped
by souls uninspired by lucre—is starved to death and
crushed, limp and lifeless, by the thumbscrews of a vain,
shallow, mercenary mushroom aristocracy on the one
hand, and an equally selfish, crude, ignorant, money-grabbing
working class on the other. But let me say
again it is the East End, the ever watchful, never
slumbering East End, that is the thermometer of future
events. And why? Because it is here that the lean,
hungry men of letters, who seldom, if ever, get their
thoughts transferred to print, are even now threshing
out the nation’s destiny. Threshing it out, consolidating
it, whilst the monied men and women, the present all-powerful
nouveau riche—the beer, whiskey and tobacco,
peers and peeresses—the lords of the Stock Exchange,
Banks and Divorce Courts—those who have made their
money out of the sins and follies of the world, or by
sweating and usury, are lolling in their soft, upholstered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
chairs, smoking luxurious cigars and quaffing liqueurs.</p>

<p>The war has done much: it has aroused patriotism,
it has given rise to self-sacrifice, but it has not touched
the root of the gangrene, it has not lessened our worship
of the dollar. Individualism, as we know it to-day, must
collapse, and some better and purer system—a system
that does not encourage selfishness—must prevail. The
people are dying for change—for some great change that
will give them fair play. This is the people’s need—the
need that you may hear voiced throughout the length
and breadth of the squalid East End. “We want a
Government that remembers its primary duties,” they
cry. “A Government that is father to its children, that
loves, fosters and protects them. We have never had
one yet, but the hour may not be far distant when we
shall demand one.” This is what the people of leisure
might learn, if they visited the haunts I visit; and they
might learn more beside. They might learn of another
world, a spirit world, such as is never alluded to in the
pulpits, with which people in the poorest parts—people
who are too poor to pay for beds—are forced to live in
contact. Nights in the parks and commons have taught
these vagrants more, a thousand times more, than they
ever learned in Sunday or County Council Schools.
They have seen sights—spirits in the form of man and of
beast, of both and of neither—that have revealed to
them how closely the other world borders on this, and to
what close supervision the inhabitants of the other
world subject some of us. They have learned, I say,
what no priest or preacher would, or could, teach them,
namely, that the hell of spirit-land lies on this earth,
and that the worst of all punishments is that of the poor
phantasms of the dead, that glides in and out the trees
nocturnally, never meeting those it knew and loved, but
ever encountering the most terrifying of the spirits that
are hostile to man.</p>

<p>“What gives me the worst fright is a tree....”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Our vagrants know, too, the power of these neutrarians,
they know they can adopt any shape, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
tempt and goad man on to the committal of any crime,
however heinous. They have, moreover, acquired a
further knowledge—a knowledge denied and scoffed at
by the ministry of all Christian denominations—namely
that all forms of animal and vegetable life, all forms of
flora and fauna, pass into the superphysical, and live
again.</p>

<p>I myself first learned of a tree ghost from an old
tramp, who came and sat by my side on a seat on
Clapham Common.</p>

<p>“Do I ever see anything strange here at night?” he
repeated in answer to my question. “Yes, I do, at
times, but what gives me the worst fright is a tree that I
sometimes see close to the spot where that man was
murdered some ten or twelve years ago. I never saw it
before the murder, but a few nights afterwards, as I was
passing the spot, I saw a peculiar glimmer of white, and,
on getting a bit closer, I found, to my astonishment,
that it was a tall, slender white thing with branches just
like a tree, only it was not behaving like a tree. Although
there was not a breath of wind, it kept lurching with a
strange, creaking noise, and I felt it was watching me,
watching me furtively, just as if it had eyes, and was
bent on doing me all the harm it possibly could. I was
so scared, I turned tail, and never ceased running till I
had reached home.”</p>

<p>“Home!” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, a clump of bushes near the ditch, where I
always turn in of nights. It ain’t much of a home, to be
sure, but it’s the only one I’ve got, and I can generally
count on lying there undisturbed till the morning.”</p>

<p>I gave him a few coppers, and he blessed me as if I
had given him a fortune.</p>

<p>On Tooting Common I met a Northumberland miner,
who had come to London for the first time on a holiday,
and, having had his pocket picked, was obliged to spend
the night out-of-doors. “Ghosts,” he said, when I
asked him if he had any experiences with the supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
whilst engaged in his underground work.
“Ghosts! Yes, but of a nature you don’t read about in
books. Me and my mates, when working in a drift at
night, have heard the blowing of the wind and a mighty
rustling of leaves, and have found ourselves surrounded
on all sides by numerous trees and ferns that have
suddenly risen from the ground and formed a regular
forest. They have not resembled any trees you see now-a-days,
but what you might fancy existed many thousands
of years ago. There has been no colour in them,
only a uniform whiteness, and they have shone like
phosphorous. We have heard, too, all the noises, such
as go on daily in forests above-ground—the humming
and buzzing of insects, and the chirping of birds; and
shafts and galleries have echoed and re-echoed with the
sounds, till you would have thought that those away
above us must have heard them, too.”</p>

<p>I do not think the miner romanced, for what he said
was only a corroboration of what other miners have
often told me.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not every mine that is haunted in this
way, or every miner that sees such sights, for the
Unknown confines its manifestations to the few, but I
firmly believe such phenomena do happen, because as I
state in my “Byways of Ghostland” (W. Rider &amp; Sons),
I have seen several tree ghosts myself. If one form of
life possesses a spirit, why should we not assume that
other forms of life possess a spirit, too? Why should
man have the monopoly of an immaterial self, and alone
of all creation continue his identity after physical
dissolution? On moral grounds? No! For man,
generally speaking, is in no sense superior morally to the
so-called beasts around him. He is often the reverse.
Oddly enough, we have so long accustomed ourselves to
using the term immorality exclusively in reference to our
illegal relations with the other sex, that we have come to
regard these illegal relations as the only immorality
existing. It is a curious error. Immorality comprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
theft, and theft not only comprehends depriving people
of their material goods, it comprehends slander and
gossip—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, depriving people of their character; sweating—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
depriving people of the just rewards of their
mental and manual labour; and bread-snatching,—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
depriving people of their only means of existence;
beside many other acts of an equally odious nature.
The average drawing-room is invariably the rendezvous
of immoral people; nine out of every ten of the ladies
one meets there are robbers—they steal, almost at very
breath, someone’s good name and reputation, a far
worse crime than the purloining of a loaf, for which act
of desperation a poor man would be sent to prison, and
a hungry dog beaten. In the drawing-room, too, one
meets the girl with a few hundred a year, who announces
her intention of taking some post—maybe on the stage,
or on the staff of some paper, or in a business house,
“just to make a little money.” A little money at the
expense of someone else’s life! For that is what the
want of occupation to the person with no private income
literally means. We see none of this mean immorality
in the animal world. Dogs steal bones from one another,
it is true, but they do not lie, and cheat, and intrigue;
nor do they, when they have a sufficiency themselves,
snatch away the little that constitutes another person’s
all.</p>

<p>Animals are accused of being cruel—of barbarously
murdering one another, as in the cases of the cat and
mouse, the lion and deer, etc. But they rarely kill,
saving when they are hungry, and for food man kills, too,
in a fashion and with a method which is truly disgusting.
By studiously looking after the daily wants of certain
animals, such as cows and sheep, and by caring for them
when they are ill, man leads them to suppose he is their
friend, and they learn to trust him. Vain faith. He is
kind to them only to suit his own ends. He out-Judas’s
Judas, and after nonchalantly accepting their most
lavish tributes of affection, he takes them unawares and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
kills them, either with a poleaxe, or some other weapon
entailing an equally painful and lingering death. Do any
animals behave quite so basely? Besides, there is no
cruelty in the animal world—not even the most excruciating
suction of the octopus, nor the sharp, agonising bite
of the flesh-eating parrot of New Zealand—that can for
one moment compare with the coolly planned and
leisurely executed horrors of the Spanish Inquisition;
and the tiger, at its worst, is but a tyro in savagery
compared with the creature God is said to have made in
His own image.</p>

<p>From vices turn to virtues, and pause for a moment in
reflection on the many lovable qualities of the dog.
Where in man do we find such affection, forgiveness,
general amiability, constancy and patience; and in the
case of the horse, such a willingness to labour without
any thought of recompense. It makes me positively ill,
when I hear hopelessly immoral men and women—gossips,
slanderers, breadsnatchers, usurers, sweaters—speak
condescendingly of animals—of dogs and horses that
are on an infinitely higher moral plane than ever they
have been, or ever will be. But moral superiority is not
the only superiority that man fallaciously assumes. He
lays claim to an intellectual superiority, which is equally
fallacious, equally a myth. No one who has ever studied
animal and insect life can but have been impressed with
the marvels of ingenuity and skill displayed therein.
The web of the common garden spider and the nest of
the wren, for example, are every whit as wonderful in
their way as the architectural works of Inigo Jones or
Christopher Wren. On the grounds of a moral and
mental inferiority, therefore, the argument of a future
life for the human species only, fails. Another argument,
an argument advanced by the most bigotted of the
religious denominationalists, is “that man only has a
conscience, and that conscience which he alone possesses
is the only passport to another world. Without conscience
there can be no soul, and without soul there can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hope of a continuation of life after death.” This, of
course, is merely assumption, as is nearly all the teaching
of the Churches. Conscience, like religion, depends to a
very large extent on climate. A man born in the centre
of Africa might not think it wrong to do things that
would appear appalling to a Plymouth Brother, and
vice versa. There is at present no fixed and universal
standard of right and wrong, any more than there is a
fixed and universal standard of beauty—for as each eye
forms its own idea of feminine loveliness, so each heart
forms its own conception of honour and dishonour,
virtue and vice. We know that this is the case as far as
mankind is concerned, and we have nothing beyond
assumption to assure us that it is not so throughout the
animal and insect world. If the animals have no conception
of a moral standard, how is it that they do not
destroy one another? That the instinct to injure people
is innate in us is readily proved by the joy nearly all of
us take in saying disparaging things of our neighbours.
We go so far, and we would undoubtedly go the whole
hog and kill those we hate, if something more, perhaps,
than the mere fear of hanging did not hold us back.
That restraining something is unquestionably the fear of
the Future, and it is that fear which I am inclined to
think is the origin of what we term our consciences.
Were we sure there was no future existence, there would
be no moral restraint (it would only be the prospect
of legal punishment that would deter us from injuring
other people to our heart’s content), we should have no
consciences; and if this is applicable to mankind, why is
it not applicable to other forms of animal life?</p>

<p>Is it not feasible to suppose that it is this same fear of
the future that acts as a preventive to animals killing
one another indiscriminately? That they do at times
rob and kill for other motives than to satisfy their
hunger is indisputable, but these exceptional cases prove
what I am trying to maintain—that there is some
restraining influence that keeps the vast majority highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
moral; and I see no feasible arguments for not supposing
this influence to be a conscience begat by a deep-rooted
fear of what may await them on physical dissolution.</p>

<p>And if this applies to the mammals, why not to the
whole animal, insect, and vegetable worlds—to everything
that has life, for Science has yet to prove that
where there is life, there is not also intelligence.</p>

<p>The superior morality of animals to man, then, may be
considered as due to their more powerful consciences,
and to their stronger fear of the possibility of the superphysical.
And why should they have a much stronger
fear? Because, unquestionably, they have a more
intimate knowledge of the Unknown than has man. No
one who has had much to do with dogs and horses can
doubt this. Who that has ridden through woods and
jungles, or lonely country roads at night, has not seen
their horse suddenly stop and evince every evidence of
fear. Though the human eye has seen nothing to
account for it, the horse obviously has seen something,
and it has only been by dint of the utmost coaxing and
petting that the sagacious animal has been persuaded
to continue its course. It is the same with dogs. Over
and over again I have had dogs with me in houses
alleged to be haunted, and they have suddenly manifested
symptoms of the greatest, the most uncontrollable fear.
I have endeavoured to pacify them, to urge them to
follow me, but it has been in vain; though obedient and
fearless as a rule, they have suddenly become the most
disobedient and incorrigible of cowards. Why? Because
I am certain they have seen and heard things which, for
some unaccountable reason, have been held back from
me.</p>

<p>If knowledge, then, of another life is any plea for the
bestowal of an unperishable spirit, animals should live
again even more surely than man. And so also should
the vegetable world, for I have myself seen trees violently
agitated, as if with paroxysms of the most sublime
terror, before the advent of superphysical phenomena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>And stronger than any of these arguments is that of
the ghosts themselves. There are innumerable and well-authenticated
cases of hauntings by the phantasms of
dogs, horses, birds, insects, and trees, and it is, perhaps,
chiefly through these hauntings that we can disprove
the theory that man possesses a monopoly of the immaterial
planes; a theory which, were it not for his insufferable
egotism and conceit, he would never have
advanced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="subt">A HAUNTING IN REGENT’S PARK, AND MY FURTHER
VIEWS WITH REGARD TO SPIRITUALISM</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Before</span> concluding my experiences in the parks and
commons of London, I will cite one other case, a case
which serves to illustrate the theme I have just been
discussing.</p>

<p>I was visiting the Zoological Gardens in Regent’s Park,
one day in the summer of 1898, and was so struck with
the look of yearning in the eyes of one of the lions, the
desperate look of yearning to have just five minutes’
gambol on the sunny lawn outside, five minutes in which
to stretch its poor, cramped-up limbs, and sniff, perhaps
for the first time, the fine fresh air of freedom, that I
could not refrain from mentioning what was passing in
my mind to a white-haired old man and a plainly dressed
young woman, who were standing near.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the old man said. “It does seem hard on
these huge animals to be confined within the limits of
such a very small space and to have to pace up and down
these little boxes, tantalised by the sight of other
creatures enjoying the privileges that are denied to them.
It is worse treatment than any meted out to criminals;
in fact, the biggest ruffian in jail does not suffer in anything
like the same degree as these animals. They have
one thing to be thankful for, however—life cannot last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
for ever. Death will be their kindest friend. It is the
rich man’s purgatory, but it is Paradise for all these
creatures as well as for the poor man.”</p>

<p>“You believe in another world, then?” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Believe in another world?” he answered sharply,
“why, of course I do. I have seen far too much of it to
do otherwise, haven’t I, Minnie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandad,” the girl said simply.</p>

<p>“We both have, Minnie and I,” the old man went on.</p>

<p>“Spirits?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, spirits. Ghosts, if you like,” he said.</p>

<p>“Tell me. I’m not one of the scoffers,” I pleaded.</p>

<p>He looked at me searchingly, and then said: “I used
to be a keeper here many years ago. I was devoted to
the animals, and when they died, I invariably saw their
ghosts. So did some of the other keepers. Now don’t
run away with the idea that the Gardens are haunted,
sir. As far as I know, they are not. It was only to us
who had so much to do with them when they were alive
that the spirits of these animals appeared. I remember
one instance in particular, about twelve years ago, just
before I left the Zoo. A young lion came here from
East Africa. It wouldn’t let any of the keepers go near
it excepting myself, and it was generally regarded as
having a very uncertain temper. But I never found it so.
I knew that the reason of its restlessness was its hatred
of confinement. I knew it hated its cage, and I used to
do all I could to comfort it. There was a sort of mutual
understanding between us. When it saw me looking a
bit anxious and worried, for my wife was often ill, it used
to come and rub its great head against me, as if to cheer
me up, and when I saw it looking more than usually
dejected, I used to stop and talk to it for a longer time
than I talked to any one of the other animals. Well, one
day it fell ill, caught a chill, so we thought, and evinced
a strong dislike to its food. I discussed its case with the
other keepers, and they agreed there was nothing to be
alarmed about, as it was young and to all appearances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
healthy. We all thought it would be well again in a few
days. I had gone home as usual one night, and was
sitting in the kitchen reading the evening paper, when
something came over me that I must go for a walk. I
told Minnie, who was a little girl then, not more than
nine or ten years of age, and she begged her mother to let
her go with me. We started off with the intention of
going to the Caledonian Road, as Minnie liked looking at
the shops there, but we hadn’t gone far before Minnie
suddenly exclaimed, ‘Grandad, let’s go to Regent’s
Park.’ ‘Regent’s Park,’ I ejaculated; ‘whatever do
you want to go there for at this time of night!’ ‘I don’t
know,’ she said, ‘but I feel I must.’ ‘Well now,’ I
replied, ‘that’s odd, because the very same feeling has
come over me.’</p>

<p>“We struck off down Crowndale Road—I was living
in the neighbourhood of the St. Pancras Road then—and
got to Gloucester Gate just about dusk. We had
passed through, and were walking along the Broad Walk
by the side of the Zoo, when Minnie suddenly caught
hold of my arm, and said, ‘Look, Grandad!’ I followed
the direction of her gaze, and there coming straight
towards us from the Zoo walls was a lion. I can tell you
it gave me a jump, as I naturally thought one of the
animals had escaped. It aimed straight for us, and upon
its getting close to I recognised it at once—it was the
young lion that had been taken ill. To my astonishment,
however, there was nothing of the invalid about it now.
The expression in its eyes was one of infinite happiness.
It seemed to say, ‘I have attained my ideal; I am out in
the open, in the sweet, fresh air, and the wide darkness of
the fast approaching night.’ It came right up to us, and
I stretched out my hand to touch it, wondering what the
passers-by would do when they saw it, and how on earth
we should get it back into the gardens. It bitterly
grieved me to think it would have to lose its freedom. I
stretched out my hand, I say, to touch it, and to my
surprise my fingers encountered nothing—the lion had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
vanished. I then realised what Minnie had known all
along—that what we had seen was a ghost. A ghost,
and yet it had appeared to me so absolutely real and
life-like.”</p>

<p>“How did you know it was a ghost?” I enquired of
the young woman.</p>

<p>“By the curious kind of light that seemed to emanate
from all over its body,” she replied. “I can only
describe it as a kind of glow, something like that of a
glow-worm. It was not a bit natural.”</p>

<p>“But you saw the figure distinctly?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she responded, “very distinctly, and I wasn’t
the least bit afraid.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you the sequel, sir,” the old man interrupted.
“On my arrival at the Zoo in the morning, one
of the men came running up to me. ‘It’s dead!’ he
said. ‘Dead!’ I cried. ‘Who’s dead?’ ‘Why, that
young lion of yours,’ was the reply; ‘it died at eight
o’clock last night.’</p>

<p>“And, sure enough, when I went into the lion-house,
there was the animal lying stretched out at full length in
its cage—dead. It had died at eight o’clock, which was
the exact time we had seen it in the park.”</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span></p>

<p>And now to pursue the thread of my own life, which
must of necessity run through this volume. While I
was teaching at Blackheath, I not only completed my
first novel, “For Satan’s Sake,” but studied for the
stage at the Henry Neville Studio in Oxford Street. I
shall never forget with what joy, when my duties with
the spoilt and tiresome boys were over, I exchanged the
terrible monotony of the schoolroom for the delightful
and interesting atmosphere of the Studio. Henry
Neville did not teach there himself, but periodically
came to watch and help us with his criticisms, which were
always as kindly and instructive as they were utterly
free from pomposity and egotism. Easy and natural
himself, he tried to infuse something of his spirit into us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and with many of us, I believe, he succeeded; for even
those who did not believe that acting could be taught,
were bound to admit that the pupils of Henry Neville
were singularly free from the staginess almost always
seen in amateurs, and sometimes in professionals as well.</p>

<p>Henry Neville’s brother, Fred Gartside, who gave me
my first lesson in elocution—an abler or more persevering
instructor could not have been found—left off teaching
at the Studio soon after I joined. Mr. G.&nbsp;R. Foss took
his place, and is, I believe, still at the head of it.</p>

<p>I have always looked upon G.&nbsp;R. Foss as one of the
greatest stage geniuses I have ever met. He is that
rarest of all individuals—the born actor—the man who
can perform almost any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> with equal success. He is
the ideal stage manager, a past master in the knowledge
of all the technicalities adhering to the theatre, and the
possessor of a never-ceasing flow of wit and good humour.</p>

<p>Among the pupils who were at the Studio with me,
several have performed in London. I toured with George
Desmond, who was quite recently playing in the West
End, and I met Miss Yvonne Orchardson again, some
two or more years ago, when she was also acting in a
London theatre, whilst I constantly see that charming
and talented old Nevillite, Miss Lilian North, who
delights London audiences with her sweetly told stories
and good recitations. Apart from many other personal
attractions, Miss North has the most beautiful hands;
the fingers are long and tapering and the nails exquisitely
shaped. It is the rarest combination of the psychic and
dramatic hand, and such as I have very seldom seen
saving among Orientals.</p>

<p>If I have spoken somewhat extravagantly of the
Neville Studio, its instructors and pupils, it is only what
I genuinely feel, and I repeat, again, that the hours
there were some of the most delightful I have ever
experienced. When I had completed my course of
instruction, I went on tour in “A Night Out.” I then
came back to London and remained nearly a year in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Town, writing in the day-time and playing in one or
other of the suburbs in the evening. I lived, for the
most part, in St. James’ Road, Brixton, where I wrote
my second and third books, both novels, and entitled
respectively “The Unknown Depths” and “Dinevah
the Beautiful.”</p>

<p>“The Unknown Depths,” founded to a large extent
upon my own life, introduces the subject of Spiritualism,
or, as it is now more often termed, Spiritism, and, whilst
I was engaged on it, I attended many séances.</p>

<p>I am often asked to express an opinion on Spiritualism.</p>

<p>I am very averse from any attempt to invoke spirits,
either through the aid of spells or mediums, by table-turning,
or by automatic writing. As I have already
said, I believe that genuine spirits do occasionally
manifest themselves at séances, but that, when they
do, the medium is quite as surprised at the manifestation
as the sitters, and in no greater a degree, perhaps,
responsible for it. I believe the spirit I have named
neutrarian is the only type of spirit that takes advantage
of a séance, that is to say, takes advantage of the peculiar
magnetic atmosphere created at a séance. It adopts the
form, or attributes, of some relative or friend of one of
the sitters, and, thus disguised, manifests itself merely
for the sake of deceiving and misleading over-credulous
men and women. But unfortunately these spirits do not
stop at mere mischief. Having once gained a footing,
so to speak, they can attach themselves to certain
people, and by tormenting them continually, drive them
in the end to madness and suicide.</p>

<p>In addition to the danger of attracting undesirable
neutrarians at séances, there is the risk of being duped
by mediums. I have met a good many professional
mediums—so-called clairvoyants, aura tellers, psychometrists,
materialising mediums, and the like, and none
of them have convinced me that they can do all that they
profess to do. Besides, even if they could, the mere
suggestion that one’s spirit friend or relative is tapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
on a wall or blowing through a trumpet, presumably to
satisfy the curiosity of a number of strangers, and
incidentally to fill the coffers of an illiterate man or
woman, only fills one with disgust. If any departed
friends of mine wish to visit me, I am sure they could do
so without the assistance of a so-called medium and all
their paltry paraphernalia. The usual argument in
defence of these mediums is that some well-known
scientific man believes in them. “If Sir somebody or
other says I am genuine,” the clairvoyant exclaims,
“then I am genuine, and you’ve no right in the world to
doubt me.”</p>

<p>The medium is wrong. I have every right. Scientists
may be very shrewd, perhaps infallible in their own
legitimate calling, but, outside it, their opinion need
carry no more weight than mine, or yours, or anyone
else’s.</p>

<p>It by no means follows that because a man is a
Professor of Physics he is also a great student of character.
Poring over chemicals or figures all day is a very
poor training for reading the human mind. An actor is a
far more able exponent of psychology than any chemist
or mathematician, and this being so, it is the actor who
should play a prominent part in psychical research and
not the scientist. If a veteran actor were to say to me,
“Look here, I have watched that woman very carefully
when she was supposed to go into a trance, and to speak
in an entirely different voice from her own, and I am
convinced she is merely acting,” I should be inclined to
believe him. In his wide experience of facial expression,
posing, and assumed voices, it would be comparatively
easy for him to tell whether the medium was shamming
or not. A clever actress can disguise her voice effectually,
and no one would know it. She can speak with a French
accent one moment and broad cockney the next, and so
naturally that few people would know she was the same
person. That is why, when I have listened to a clairvoyant,
in an alleged trance, speaking in the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Tommy Jones or some other presumed obsessing spirit,
I have been unmoved. There are a dozen actresses of
my acquaintance who could easily do the same. But
someone exclaims, “She actually spoke in Russian, a
language she knows nothing about.” “How do you
know she is unacquainted with Russian?” is my answer;
no one can possibly tell that but herself. She has most
likely acquired a smattering of it, simply for this purpose.
What could be easier? I have a smattering of a good
many languages, but I could easily stimulate complete
ignorance of any one or all of them; I repeat, no one
knows but ourselves how much we have seen, and read,
and heard, where we have been, and what we have
studied, and, if we are sufficiently clever, we can let the
outside world know just as much as we want it to know
and no more. Some mediums are said to act in one
manner when they are obsessed, and in an entirely
different manner when in their normal condition. What
futile rubbish! Who knows when they are in their
normal condition, or what their normal condition really
is? Most of us are complex. I myself have several
distinct personalities—and I defy anyone to enumerate
them—any one of which might be equally my true,
my normal self. Moreover, I might go into a trance,
speak with the voice of a Spaniard, and behave like
a Red Indian, and those who saw me would think
me obsessed. Yet they might easily be mistaken. I
might have secretly acquired a smattering of Spanish,
and one of my hobbies might be that of imitating,
in private, the ways and habits of a Sioux or Crow
Foot.</p>

<p>I know a clergyman who attracts large congregations
by reason of his eloquence and apparent piety, and who
is believed in his parish to be most moral and sincere. I
also know him to spend several evenings a week in an
East End tavern, singing ribald songs and playing poker.
Which is his true self, which his normal condition? His
congregation believe him to be one thing, his East End<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
cronies another, and he is apparently quite as much at
home in the church as he is in the tavern.</p>

<p>Then, apart from the question of personalities, I
believe another evidence of trickery lies in the non-usefulness
of any of the communications alleged to be
made by the spirits. If professional mediums could
receive bona fide communications from the other world,
I am quite sure that they would acquire some knowledge
of a practical nature, and that we should, in consequence,
soon see them all multi-millionaires. That they are not
all Vanderbilts and Rothschilds is, I think, a very strong
argument that their alleged spirit friends have told them
nothing.</p>

<p>And that is what it all amounts to—nothing. Automatic
writing, table-turning, and trances have taught us
absolutely nothing concerning either this or the other
world, and the messages purporting to come from the
spirits have hitherto, at all events, consisted of trivialities
and commonplaces of such an unedifying nature that we
cannot dissociate them from factory girls and nursemaids.</p>

<p>Our friends on the other side, who have passed through
the valley of the shadow of death, might reasonably be
expected to know something that we do not; and yet
not even the smallest fragment of their knowledge has so
far been transmitted to us through any of the channels
resorted to by Spiritualists. Neither, as far as I know,
have the police benefited by any information imparted
to them by mediums or automatic writers. On the other
hand, although the Unknown has refused to confide to
those claiming to be its chosen few any messages that
would right the wrong, bona fide phantasms of the dead
have certainly been known to appear spontaneously, to
other than professional mediums, with this intent.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span></p>

<p>I am acquainted with an old lady, who tells me that
she often talks with Charles Dickens, Napoleon
Bonaparte, Cardinal Newman and other eminents. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have enquired how, and she has reluctantly admitted
that the spirits of these eminents come to her at a
séance conducted by a professional medium, who, of
course, is paid very liberally for her services. The
medium, I gather, sits behind a screen, where she is
supposed to wait, until she is obsessed. When everything
is ready, she glides out, and in a voice purporting
to be that of Napoleon, or of someone equally distinguished,
she converses with this foolish and conceited
old lady. It seems incredible that anyone outside a
lunatic asylum could believe that the spirits of such
great men as Napoleon, Newman and Dickens should
take the trouble to obsess a medium, in order to chat with
some nonentity, who is neither extraordinarily clever nor
particularly interesting. And yet there are dozens of
people, apart from the old lady I have mentioned, who
know so little of genius and eminence, and even ordinary
talent, as to believe this incongruous happening to be
possible. I, myself, have heard a Spiritualist, who lays
down the laws respecting the Unknown, as if he were
actually the Creator, declare that, whenever he lectures,
the hall is full to overflowing with spirits. Amongst
them, he says, are the shades of Charles Dickens—there
must be at least a hundred shades of Dickens, for there is
hardly a spiritualistic meeting or séance that I hear of
at which Dickens is not alleged to be present—Sir Isaac
Newton and Napoleon. (Soon, perhaps, there will be
the Kaiser and the Crown Prince. I hope so.)</p>

<p>Family séances are, of course, quite another matter.
I have not the least doubt that when the friends and
relatives of some departed person meet together, and,
concentrating very earnestly on that dead one being
present, create the right magnetic atmosphere, that
sometimes a real spirit manifestation does take place,
and the phantasm of the deceased, or what at any rate
purports to be the phantasm of the deceased, does
actually appear.</p>

<p>The phenomenon may possibly be a neutrarian—for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of course, there is always that risk—or it may really be
the soul, spirit, or whatever else we like to call it, of the
dead person. And here let me urge again, the utter
absurdity of attempting to dogmatise on the Unknown.
At one time it was the parson, who unfolded to us, with
all the sageness of one who had been there, the mysteries
of the other world. He not only told us what we must
do and not do in order to ascend to Heaven, but he went
a step further: he told us what Heaven was like, and
what actually was taking place there. The parson of
to-day, however, does not seem quite so sure of his knowledge
on these points as he was formerly, and his statements
have become far less assertive; indeed, they have
become somewhat tentative. It is the Occultist now who
dictates. He talks with an air of absolute authority of
Astral Planes, Elementaries, Elementals, vitalised shells,
Karmas, and goodness knows what besides, and uses
such a variety of high-falutin’ terms, that our brains at
last become bewildered, and we begin to wonder with
Goldsmith how it is possible that one small head can
carry all he knows. But when we have boiled it all down,
when we have analysed his dissertation, we find that it
is, in the last resort, merely a repetition of all the old
doctrines with which we have been familiar from our
earliest youth. The only difference is that our Occultist,
chiefly by discarding the old names of dogmas, and
adopting a superfluity of new ones, has made of these
same doctrines a hotch-potch of such rare quality, that
few—if indeed any—of us can digest it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="subt">A HAUNTED MINE IN WALES</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">While</span> I was at Brixton, paying daily visits to various
well-known theatrical agencies in search of work, I
ran across the manager of a fit-up company, who
wanted a man of about my age and build to play
second lead in a melodrama. I closed with his offer, and
for the next four weeks, which was as long as his funds
held out, I paid three night visits to various towns in
Wales, winding up at Llandudno, no better off financially
than when I commenced, and having to pay my own
fare back to London.</p>

<p>If, however, my excursion into Wales was unprofitable
from the monetary standpoint, it was by no means
lacking in other respects, for, apart from the experience
I gained from playing four entirely different parts a
night, with two electric changes, I came across several
interesting cases of hauntings.</p>

<p>One of my landladies, a kindly old soul to whom I had
chatted about ghosts, introduced me to an old man,
Clem Morgan, whom she said had had a curious experience
in one of the neighbouring mines. The incident had
taken place some fifty years ago, shortly after a dreadful
explosion, whereby many scores of the miners had been
killed and injured. I will narrate the experience—merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
altering the wording of it here and there—just as
Clem Morgan narrated it to <span class="nobreak">me:—</span></p>

<p>“A thousand feet down, close to the site of a great
tragedy that had thrilled the whole country to the very
core, my mate and I were at work. Pick, pick, pick;
shovel, shovel, shovel; the sound of our instruments
must have been heard hundreds of yards away.</p>

<p>“‘George,’ I said suddenly, leaving off work, ‘was
it like this afore the accident?’</p>

<p>“‘Like what?’ George grunted. He was a middle-aged
man with a black, stubby beard, and arms like the
gnarled and knotted branches of an oak. ‘Like what?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, as lonely as this? Were you working with
just one other man, or were you with the rest of the
gang?’</p>

<p>“‘With one other,’ George responded, ‘and just as
soft as you. Why can’t you let the matter drop? I’m
sick to death of hearing about it.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a marvel to me how you escaped,’ I went on;
‘whereabouts were you?’</p>

<p>“‘Just where we are now,’ George growled, ‘and
that’s all I’ll tell you, so you’d best shut up!’</p>

<p>“‘And you went up them steps with all the hell of the
explosion ringing around you?’ I observed, advancing
to the edge of the black shaft close to where we were
working, and looking at the slender wooden ladder
leading up to the dark vault above. ‘It’s a wonder to
me you didn’t miss your footing in your hurry, and fall.
I should have done.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ve no doubt you would,’ George sneered, ‘but
I’m no tenderfoot; I was at this game when you were in
your cradle, which you never ought to have left.’</p>

<p>“‘How many feet down is it?’ I went on, peering
below me, much fascinated.</p>

<p>“‘Fourteen fathoms. We don’t reckon by feet here.
Done with that way of doing things in the schoolroom.’</p>

<p>“‘So that you would be killed outright, if you fell?’</p>

<p>“‘Try and see,’ George jeered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘It’s my brother I was thinking of, not myself,’ I
observed. ‘Where was he exactly, when the explosion
took place?’</p>

<p>“‘How can I say, boy,’ George replied, irritably.
‘I don’t know where half the folk are.’</p>

<p>“‘They told me he was in an adit leading into the
main shaft.’</p>

<p>“‘He may have been, for all I know—and for all I
care,’ George answered gruffly.</p>

<p>“‘Do you suppose it was here he was working?’ I
said, after a moment or two’s pause, during which I
again went to the shaft and peered down.</p>

<p>“‘This is not the only adit on the main,’ George
growled. ‘He wasn’t here—leastways not when I was.’</p>

<p>“‘I heard he was with a man he unintentionally
injured, and who ever after bore him a grudge.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, oh!’ George exclaimed; ‘so you know as
much as that, do you? And what, pray, was this man
like?’</p>

<p>“‘I couldn’t say,’ I replied, ‘excepting that he was
much older than Dick, and very ugly.’</p>

<p>“‘A description that would fit in with dozens
down here. If he was working with your brother, and
your brother was killed, the odds are he was killed
too.’</p>

<p>“‘You think so?’</p>

<p>“‘It seems reasonable enough, don’t it?’ George said.</p>

<p>“‘He might have escaped like you did.’</p>

<p>“‘He might,’ George laughed, ‘just in the same way
as pigs might fly. Supposing you get on with your work
and let me do the same.’</p>

<p>“‘I had a queer dream about that man,’ I went on.</p>

<p>“‘Dreams! Pooh! Who believes in dreams!’
George said. ‘What was it?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, I dreamed he had something to do with Dick’s
death and with the accident.’</p>

<p>“‘You had better tell the Inspector,’ George sneered.
‘And maybe he’ll alter his verdict. You seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
been very fond of this brother of yours. You’ve done
nothing but carp about him all the morning.’</p>

<p>“‘I was,’ I replied. ‘So were we all. He kept the
home going for the last six years.’</p>

<p>“‘Kept the home going! Why, where was you?’</p>

<p>“‘At College, studying for a teacher. I gave it up
after his death.’</p>

<p>“‘A schoolmaster! Well, I’m blowed. Then you
didn’t see much of Dick?’</p>

<p>“‘Only in the holidays.’</p>

<p>“‘And who told you about this fellow who was
supposed to have had a spite against him?’</p>

<p>“‘Mother.’</p>

<p>“‘It was your mother, was it? Only hearsay evidence
after all. Well, they’re both dead, anyhow—good and
bad, and bad and good—all went together—in a moment,
boy! What do they call you?’</p>

<p>“‘Clem.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Clem, get on with your shovelling for mercy’s
sake. I’ve had enough of talking to last me to the end
of the week.’</p>

<p>“I took up my spade, and for the next hour there were
no other sounds but the steady, mechanical pick, pick,
pick, and scrape, scrape, scrape. Every now and then
George sprang aside, there was a crash, and a huge block
of coal fell on the rocky floor, mid a blinding shower of
dust. A fraction of a second later, and George would
have been under it—his head a jelly. Yet the narrowness
of his escape did not seem to affect him; he treated it
with the utmost indifference, and, wiping away the
smuts from his eyes, took up his pick and resumed his
hitting. I regarded him in silent wonder. When the
dinner-hour arrived, I groped my way to one of the big
galleries—the idea of eating alone with George did not
appeal to me—and, an hour later, I set out on my way
back.</p>

<p>“A terrible sense of isolation hung over that part of
the mine whither I bent my steps. It was so far away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
from the other adits—so tremendously deep down—so
alarmingly dark, so sepulchrally silent. Up above, in
the fields, woods, valleys, even far away in the primitive
parts of the world, one is never quite alone, for the voice
of Nature makes itself heard in the birds and insects.
One knows one is in the midst of life. But here!—here
in the bowels of the earth, encased in the dead vegetation
of a long-forgotten world, there is absolute, all paramount
stillness—a thousand times stiller than the stillness of a
closed sepulchre. As I pressed on, the crunching of my
feet on the scattered fragments of coal awoke the echoes
of the galleries, and I paused every now and then to
listen in awe to the long reverberating echoes as they
rolled round and round me. Once, I nearly slipped;
another foot, and I would have plunged into a sable
labyrinth, the cold draught from which wound itself
round me and choked the air in my lungs.</p>

<p>“I drew back in horror, and clinging to the knobbly
surface of the black wall by my side, pressed frantically
forward. God, supposing I should ever lose my way
down here—be left behind when all the men went home—what
would become of me? The perspiration rose on
my forehead at the bare idea of it. Presently, to my
relief, the sound of picking fell on my ears, and an abrupt
turn of the passage brought me within sight of George,
who had already recommenced work. I hastened to his
side, and, picking up my shovel, began to make a neat
stack of the rapidly accumulating chunks.</p>

<p>“‘George,’ I said, after an emphatic silence, ‘why
didn’t you tell me it was you who was working along
with Dick?’</p>

<p>“‘So you’ve been asking questions, have you?’
George growled, without, however, showing the slightest
inclination to leave off working. ‘Who told you?’</p>

<p>“‘Jim and Harry Peters.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, and what of it?’</p>

<p>“‘But why didn’t you say so, when I asked
you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘What odds if I had, it wouldn’t have done you any
good.’</p>

<p>“‘Did you have a quarrel with him?’</p>

<p>“‘Did the boys tell you I had? Because if so, it’s no
use my saying anything.’</p>

<p>“‘But what do you say?’</p>

<p>“‘No! Dick and me never had no quarrel.’</p>

<p>“‘Is that true?’</p>

<p>“‘Gospel.’</p>

<p>“After this there was another silence unbroken save
by the monotonous handling of the implements. Then I
suddenly uttered an ejaculation and pointed at my cap.
It was lying on the ground, some few feet from where we
were working, close beneath a projecting block of coal,
and it was moving—moving as if it were being violently
agitated by something inside it.</p>

<p>“‘What is it?’ I demanded.</p>

<p>“‘What is what?’ George growled, resting for a
moment on the handle of his pick.</p>

<p>“‘Why, that!’ I said, pointing to my cap. ‘What
makes it move like that?’</p>

<p>“‘The wind, of course,’ George said.</p>

<p>“‘There’s not enough draught for that. See!’ I
placed a piece of paper on the ground within an inch or
two of the cap, and it remained perfectly still. ‘Something
must be underneath it.’ I picked the cap up,
there was nothing there. ‘What do you think of it
now?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“George made no reply. He turned round, so
that I could not see his face, and plied his pick
vigorously. After a few minutes I stopped work
again.</p>

<p>“‘George,’ I cried, ‘what’s the matter with your
coat? Look! It’s doing just as your cap did.’</p>

<p>“George threw down his pick with an oath.</p>

<p>“‘What do you want to keep worrying me for?’ he
said. ‘What’s wrong now?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, your coat! Look! it’s moving—rising up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and down as if the wind were blowing it—and there’s
not an atom of draught.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s your fancy,’ George said hoarsely. ‘The
coat’s not moving.’</p>

<p>“‘What,’ I cried, ‘do you mean to say you can’t
see it moving?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ George replied. ‘It’s not, I tell you.’ And
picking up his tool he set to work again, even more
vigorously than before.</p>

<p>“Some minutes later I again stopped. ‘Heavens!’ I
exclaimed. ‘Look at my lamp! It’s burning blue!
What makes it do that?’</p>

<p>“George paused—his pick shoulder high—and looked
round. ‘Nonsense,’ he said savagely. ‘You are——’
Then he left off and his jaws dropped. ‘It must be
some chemical in it,’ he stammered. ‘Let the damned
thing be; it’ll soon right itself.’</p>

<p>“‘This is a strange place, George!’ I said slowly.</p>

<p>“‘Why strange?’ George snapped.</p>

<p>“‘Well, first of all there was my cap, then your coat,
and now the lantern—all doing something queer. Have
you ever known the likes of it before?’</p>

<p>“‘Often,’ George muttered. ‘Scores of times. Funny
things is always happening below ground; you’ll get
used to them in time.’</p>

<p>“‘And yet you look a bit scared.’</p>

<p>“‘Do I?’ George grunted. ‘Well, I’m not. By ——,
I’m not. You can’t always judge by looks, you know.’
And, raising his pick, he attacked the coal furiously.</p>

<p>“The afternoon was now waning. Outside, away on
the top, where the only roof was the heavens, the sun had
sunk to the level of the pine-trees, from whose straight
and gently-swaying bodies the grotesque shadows of the
night were beginning to steal. It is a peculiarity of the
mines that, however deep down they may be, they yet
feel the influence of time, and the departure of the
sunlight from above creates an immediate increase in
the gloom below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“On this afternoon in particular I felt the change
acutely. A darkness, that did not seem to be merely the
darkness due to time, stole down the pit’s mouth and
permeated adits, shafts, galleries—everywhere and
everything.</p>

<p>“My light was still burning blue, but beyond it, down
in the great, gaping chasm, not ten feet from him, and
away along the narrow, winding passage separating me
from the rest of the gang, all was black—a denser black
than I had conceived possible. I was staring around,
too fascinated to go on with my work, when something
icy cold gripped my fingers, and, looking down, I saw
a big, white hand lying on the top of mine. I gave
a yell and dropped my shovel—whereupon the hand
vanished.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter now, curse you!’ George said
angrily. ‘If you keep on hindering me like this, I’ll tell
the overseer. See if I don’t.’</p>

<p>“‘The place is haunted,’ I gasped. ‘A hand caught
hold of mine just now.’</p>

<p>“‘A hand! Rot. What next?’ And George forced
a laugh.</p>

<p>“‘I’m certain it was a hand,’ I said, ‘and it had a
ring on like my brother Dick’s.’</p>

<p>“‘You’ve got Dick on the brain, which is only natural,
seeing that you was fond of him, and he only just dead.
In a few days’ time you will get over it and laugh at
your present fears. There’s no hands here but yours and
mine, lad!’</p>

<p>“‘Aren’t there?’ I said quietly. ‘Then what is that
just below yours on the pick.’</p>

<p>“George looked down. Instead of two hands—his
own two hands—on the pick, there were three, and the
third was white and luminous. With a shriek, George
dropped the pick, and sprang away from it, as if it had
been a serpent.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill7"></a>
<img src="images/ill7.jpg" width="394" height="620" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>“My God! There’s Dick! He’s just behind you”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“‘Do you believe me now?’ I remarked. ‘If that
wasn’t Dick’s hand, I’ve never seen it. Besides, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
swear to his ring among a thousand. Have you noticed
how dark it has been getting?’</p>

<p>“‘I’ve noticed nothing,’ George muttered, picking up
his tool. ‘It’s all your talk that has done it—you’ve
upset my nerves.’ He raised his pick and began to work
again, but his hands shook so much he struck his leg and
dropped the implement with a cry of pain.</p>

<p>“‘It’s nothing,’ he growled, as I sprang to his side;
‘only the skin grazed. But I reckon I’ll sit down a bit—I’m
all of a tremble.’</p>

<p>“He had moved nearer to the edge of the pit, and
was about to sit down with his back towards it, when I
cried, ‘My God! There’s Dick! He’s just behind you.
He’s pointing at you, George. I see it all now! George,
you devil—you murdered him!’</p>

<p>“George looked round—and there, bending over him,
was a tall figure, with a strangely white face. He threw
out his hands to keep the figure off, and, as he did so, he
slipped, and fell, with one loud yell of terror, into the pit.
I heard him strike the side of the great abyss once—then
thud—that was all!</p>

<p>“Sick at heart, I reeled back to the safety of the
niche where we had been working, and, as I did so, my
eyes fell on the lamp—the flame was now white and
normal.</p>

<p>“A rescue party that went in search of George found
him in a dying condition at the bottom of the shaft. The
fact that he was not killed outright was due to his having
fallen in a foot or two of mud and water, which had
somewhat broken the force of the concussion. He was
fatally injured, but he lingered just long enough to
confess that he, and he only, was to blame for the recent
disaster. He had had a violent quarrel with Dick, whom
he had hated, and, when Dick’s back was turned, he had
struck him over the head with his pick and killed him.
Seized with horror, he then dragged Dick’s body into
the passage, and, in order to minimise the risk of discovery,
had saturated it with paraffin and set fire to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
He had had just time enough to reach the ladder leading
up from the shaft, and climb up it, before the explosion
had taken place.”</p>

<p>The Welsh miners are at times magnanimous, and on
this occasion they agreed to keep George’s crime a
secret. To give publicity to the affair, they argued,
would not give them back the relatives they had lost,
and would only do harm to the dead man’s widow and
family, who were left almost penniless. Thus the matter
ended, and to the outside world the cause of the explosion
remained, as before, a mystery.</p>

<p>Of course, it may be said of this case that it has no
great value from the evidental point of view, no one
having witnessed the ghostly happening but Morgan
and the man who was subsequently killed. This may be.
At the same time much depends upon the character of a
witness, and the evidence of one man, who is reliable, is
surely worth more than the evidence of several men who
are not reliable.</p>

<p>Morgan told his story in a simple, straightforward
manner, and I believed him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="subt">THE POOL IN WALES THAT LURES PEOPLE TO DEATH</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">I think</span> there is very little doubt that two of the mediums
through which the occult forces “get at” humanity are
colour and locality. Red, for example, being the colour
of blood, is made the medium for instilling thoughts of
murder; green, in a similar manner, is used to suggest
suicide by drowning; yellow suggests madness; pink—vice
of the most alluring and attractive nature; and so
on, until, by a careful study of human crimes in their
relation to colour, one might tabulate a complete list.</p>

<p>And so with localities. Certain spots attract certain
types of spirits, and these, in turn, suggest certain
thoughts, some beautiful and some the reverse.</p>

<p>I was still in North Wales, when, a week or so before
the expiration of the tour, I did a day’s tramping on the
hills, and, being caught in a heavy rain-storm, I had to
take shelter under one of those low stone walls with
which the whole country-side is intersected. The afternoon
was drawing to a close, and the fading light made
me a bit anxious as to how I should find my way back
to my lodgings. As I was crouching there, praying to
heaven that the storm would soon cease, so that I could
continue my way, I suddenly heard a loud cry, as of
someone in distress, and, on its being repeated, I scrambled
up and hastened in the direction of the sounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
About a hundred yards further on there was a break in
the wall, and I caught the glimmer of water. It was one
of those roadside pools, not uncommon in Wales, and
usually of great depth. As I drew nearer, I saw it was
fringed on the far side by a cluster of tall pines, that
creaked and groaned dismally as the strong west wind
drove volumes of water through their bowed branches.</p>

<p>I was noticing all this, when the form of a man in a
mackintosh rose from the gorze close by my side, and,
thrusting his head forward so that I could not see his
face, walked with great swinging strides towards the
pool. I thought this rather queer, but I thought it still
queerer when the cries I had heard before broke out
again with increased violence, unmistakably this time
from the trees, and the man, breaking into a run, rushed
up to the margin of the pool, where he abruptly disappeared.</p>

<p>I was close behind him at the time, and am positive
he did not enter the water. His whole body seemed to
melt away as he stood on the bank. What became of
him I could not say, I only know he vanished. The
incident so unnerved me that it was only with a considerable
effort of mind I went on. I threaded my way
through the trees, and looked everywhere, but there
was no one about and nothing whatever, as far as I
could see, to account for the sounds. I looked at the
water: it was inky black, and there was something
sinister about it, something that strangely suggested to
me, that away down in its cold, still depths was life—some
peculiar, venomous, repellant living thing that
was watching me, and longing to entwine its arms round
me, and drag me ruthlessly down. I was appalled.
The apparent loneliness of the spot was frightful, and,
as I tore myself away and renewed my journey home, I
fancied I heard laughter—laughter in which all the trees
seemed to join in chorus. On arriving at my rooms, I
enquired about the pool, and my landlady informed me
it bore a very evil reputation. Several people had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
found drowned there, and no one would go near it after
dark. This stimulated me to make further enquiries. I
came across one or two men who testified to having
heard cries there, and one old woman, who declared she
had seen a curious figure, half human and half animal,
vanish in the pine trees; but I could get nothing in the
way of details for some months, not until I had returned
to London, when, quite by chance and under rather
extraordinary circumstances, I was introduced to a man,
long since dead, who many years before had had a
somewhat harrowing experience there. The gist of what
he narrated to me was as <span class="nobreak">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“Philip Delaney was a member of the London Stock
Exchange, and at nine-thirty one August evening was
sitting before the empty grate in his study, smoking.
Though not naturally a pessimist, his thoughts were at
that moment excessively gloomy; business during the
past few years had been steadily getting worse and
worse, and it now seemed as if the day of general stagnation
must be very near at hand. From an average of
fifteen hundred a year his income had fallen to less than
eight hundred. Consequently, he could not as usual take
his holiday abroad; he could only just afford to send
his wife and children to Hastings, where he might
possibly be able to join them for week-ends. As a
fitting accompaniment to his thoughts, the weather was
vile, cold and wet—eternally wet. He could hear the
raindrops beating against the glass, and falling on the
window-sill with an incessant, wearying and worrying
patter. He was too depressed to read, it was too early
to sleep, he could only sit and think, everlastingly
think. Indeed, he was deeply engaged in thought—thought
in which two, and two and a half percentages
were paramount—when, hearing someone cough, he
turned sharply round. No one was there.</p>

<p>“This was odd. He could have sworn the sound
came from just behind him. With his eyes focussed on
the door, he listened. The cough was repeated, footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
accompanied it, and from out of the wall stepped
the figure of a man. Philip Delaney gasped in astonishment.
He recognised the figure at once. It was Markham
Davidson, a very old friend of his, the author of
several well-known works on Metaphysics and Psychology.
There was nothing peculiar about him—features,
complexion, expression, clothes, and walk were all
perfectly natural. They belonged to the Markham
Davidson he knew, but whom he had not seen for ages.
And yet, how, if he were flesh and blood, had he passed
through several inches of solid brick and mortar? How?
Unquestionably he could not have done so, unless—well,
unless he had suddenly acquired superphysical
properties, and projected his immaterial body after
the manner of one of the phantasms about which he
was so fond of writing. Walking across the room
with a quick tread, the figure displayed certain mannerisms—a
forward poke of the head, a prematurely old
stoop of the shoulders, and a bend of the arms—unmistakably
those of Davidson. Delaney noted, too,
that Markham looked remarkably well—his cheeks
were ruddy and full, his eyes were bright, his movements
full of energy. In one hand he carried a stamped
envelope, and in the other an umbrella, with which
he tapped the ground vigorously as he walked. He
moved in a straight line without looking to the right
or left, and, stepping into the wall a few feet from
the window, disappeared before Delaney could utter
a sound.</p>

<p>“As the whole occurrence had occupied so short a
space of time—three or four seconds at the most—Delaney
tried hard to persuade himself that the phenomena
was an hallucination, but, try as he would, he
could not bring himself to believe that what he had
seen was entirely subjective. There on the wall was
the very spot where the figure had emerged, and there,
exactly opposite, the very spot through which it had
vanished. No hallucination, he argued, could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
been so vivid, nor could it have embraced so many
graphic and minute details. Details! Yes, crowds
of details. He remembered them all distinctly, especially
the tie. There was a redness about it—a very peculiar
redness he did not recollect seeing in any other tie.
It impressed him greatly, and he could not eradicate it
from his mind.</p>

<p>“He noticed the envelope, too, not so much because
it was addressed to P. Delaney, Esq., as because it
was white, startlingly white, whilst the stamp was
the same very pronounced red as the tie. Long after
the figure had gone, Philip pondered over these idiosyncrasies,
and the more he thought of them, the more
perplexed he grew. What he had seen was, without
doubt, the phantasm of Markham Davidson—of the
living Markham Davidson, identical with his old friend,
Markham Davidson, in all but the colour of the tie.
Red, blood-red! What one earth could have possessed
Davidson to wear such a colour! He pondered over
this as deeply as though it had been one of the
most weighty problems of the Stock Exchange, and
when he went to bed that night and looked in his
mirror, he saw, instead of his own tie, a blood-red
one.</p>

<p>“His dreams took disturbing forms. Three times
following he saw Markham Davidson struggling for
dear life in a dreary looking pool, situated by the
side of a very lonely mountain road, and overshadowed
by tall pines, that creaked and groaned like lost souls
every time the wind smote them. With such perspicuity
were the details in these dreams stamped
on his mind, that each time he awoke he saw them
again; there they were, everywhere he turned—the
glimmering white road with the wide expanse of snow
on one side and on the other the long line of low stone
wall, beyond which lay darkness and the pool. Heavens!
what a pool it was—inky black, unfathomably deep,
and hideously suggestive of an antagonistic, insatiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
something that lay crouching in its bosom, ever on the
look-out for prey.</p>

<p>“Delaney was fascinated. Although he realised
that the very atmosphere of the place was intensely
evil, that it had a wholly demoralising effect and contaminated
everybody and everything that came near
it, although absolutely he understood all this, yet he
allowed himself to be drawn unresistingly towards
it.</p>

<p>“When he awoke from one vision of it, he craved
heaven and hell to permit him to see another. And
in this manner he passed the whole night.</p>

<p>“On coming down to breakfast, the first thing that
arrested his attention was an envelope—an envelope
addressed to him in the well-known writing of Markham
Davidson. He tore it open, and with breathless excitement
read as follows:—‘Dear Phil,—It is a very
long time since I heard from you.... An irresistible
craze has just come over me to go to North Wales.
Strange, because, as I daresay you remember, I have
always detested Wales. Now, however, I am eaten
up with a mad desire to go to Llanginney, an out-of-the-way
spot somewhere near Cader Idris. I never
heard of it till yesterday, when it suddenly attracted
my attention as I was gazing at an atlas. Will you
join me there for a day or two? I go to-morrow
(Wednesday), and intend staying a week. It would
be very pleasant once again to tramp the country-side
with you....’</p>

<p>“Delaney looked at the postmark; it was stamped
11.30 p.m. Could Davidson have been on the way
to the pillar-box, when he (Delaney) had seen his
phantasm? If that were so, then, undoubtedly, it
was a case of unconscious projection. Markham,
whilst thinking of him (Delaney) in connection with
the invitation to Llanginney, had unconsciously
separated his immaterial from his material body and
projected it. Delaney had read one or two works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
on psychic phenomena, and understood from them
that spirit projection was not only quite feasible but
far from uncommon. However, he could not accept
Davidson’s invitation. He had not the money. Go
to Llanginney, indeed! Why, Davidson might as
well have asked him to travel to Petrograd. And
yet—the pool, that white road, those shaking pine-trees,
that lurking invisible something. Could he
resist? For a solid hour he battled with himself,
battled till the sweat rose to his brow and poured
down his throat and chest. Then he decided. To
join Davidson was utterly out of the question. He
had neither the time, money, nor inclination. Like
the majority of writers, Davidson was a creature of
impulse—erratic and irresponsible. He, Philip Delaney,
was different. He was a materialist, wholly practical
and level-headed. He never acted on the spur of the
moment, never chased wild geese. In a very superior
frame of mind he sat down and wrote to Davidson,
expressing his extreme regret at not being able to accept
his invitation. Then he got up, breathed a sigh of
relief, and, clapping on his hat, went off to business.</p>

<p>“All that day, however, whilst he was brooding
over figures in his office, and listening to the ceaseless
babble at the ‘Change, his mind reverted to the pool.
It was that black piece of water, always that water,
and Davidson in his red tie, always that particular
red tie, struggling in it. At last he could stand it no
longer. He felt that even if he had to sell his wife,
and house, and children, he must yield to this attraction—this
damnable attraction—and go!</p>

<p>“Darting out of his office, shortly after luncheon, he
hurried to the railway station and took the first train
home. In less than half an hour he had made all the
necessary arrangements for a brief absence, packed
his valise and secured a hansom. (All this happened
long before the advent of taxis.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“The train was an express to Chester, but the rest
of the journey was slow, and it was nine o’clock before
he found himself on the single platform of Llangelly,
the nearest station to Llanginney.</p>

<p>“Delaney enquired as to how he was to reach his
destination, and was informed by the solitary porter
that, if he wished to get there, he must walk.</p>

<p>“‘There ain’t no vehicles for hire in this part of
the country,’ the porter said. ‘Everyone that comes
here has to use their feet. You can’t mistake the road.
You’ve only to keep straight on—and you are bound to
arrive there.’</p>

<p>“Delaney smiled grimly. He felt as little like walking
as he had ever done in his life, and, besides his gladstone,
he had a raincoat and umbrella.</p>

<p>“Fortunately the night was fine, and ere he had
covered his first half-mile, the moon broke out from
behind a cloud and illuminated the entire landscape.
For the next mile or two the road was fairly flat, and
then it gradually began to rise, the scenery becoming
wilder and wilder. Every now and then he paused,
and, throwing back his head, drank in deep breaths of
the heather-scented air. Delicious! What a change
from London! He calculated he must have done
about three-quarters of the distance, when he arrived
at a turning—the entrance to a lane—a lane that at
once made him shudder. He paused opposite the
turning, and tried to find some explanation for his
fear.</p>

<p>“It was certainly very lonely, and the white patches
of moonlight on the footpath and hedgerows suggested
much; but, after all, it was only suggestion—suggestion
which a few sunbeams would at once dissipate.
He was standing within the shadow of a clump of
firs facing the lane, and looking intently ahead of him,
when, at a distance of some fifty or so yards, the figure
of a man in a mackintosh slowly emerged from a gap in
the hedge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“The man merely glanced in Delaney’s direction,
and then, turning round, moved on down the lane.
But the glimpse, momentary though it had been,
was sufficient to enable Delaney to identify the person.
It was Davidson; he knew him at once by his mannerisms,
and he instinctively felt he had on that tie—that
flagrantly vulgar, blood-red tie. In an instant
he formed a resolution. He would give his friend
a surprise. With this intention in view he dropped
his valise, and, stepping noiselessly forward, he followed
Davidson. On and on they went, the one keeping
fifty or so yards behind the other, till there came a
sudden bend in the lane, and then Delaney received
a shock. Spread out before him, exactly as he had
seen it in his dreams, was the panorama of the white
glimmering road with the wide, wild expanse of moorland
on one side, and on the other the long line of
wall, and—the pool. Nothing could have been more
like, and it was intensified by the brilliancy of the
moonbeams. Crouching in the heather, Delaney watched
Davidson slowly walk up to the edge of the water,
fold his arms, and gaze in a reflective manner into
the shadowy depths. The moments flew by, and
still he gazed. Then there came a brief, distracting
interval, during which the moon disappeared behind
a bank of black, funereal clouds. When it emerged,
the figure of Davidson had vanished, and Delaney
occupied the spot where he had stood.</p>

<p>“‘The pool, the greedy, insatiable pool!’ he muttered.
‘Dark, deep and devilish. The three D’s.
I might even add a fourth—damnable!’ And turning
round with a chuckle, he was preparing to go, when
someone vaulted the stone wall to his left and rapidly
approached him.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t mean to say you are still pottering
about here,’ the stranger, a man about Delaney’s
own height and build, panted. ‘I thought you had
returned to the inn long ago.’ Then, perceiving his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
mistake, he said in amazement, ‘Why, it’s someone
else! I beg your pardon, sir; I quite thought you
were an acquaintance of mine.’</p>

<p>“‘Davidson, by any chance?’ Delaney asked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Markham Davidson,’ the stranger said in
astonishment. ‘Do you know him, too?’</p>

<p>“‘I am his old friend,’ Delaney laughed, ‘and I am
on my way to join him at Llanginney. I merely stopped
here to look at the pool.’</p>

<p>“‘The pool,’ the stranger ejaculated, eyeing him
curiously. ‘It is not the pleasantest place in the world,
is it?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ Delaney replied, ‘but it has its fascination.
Where did you leave Davidson?’</p>

<p>“‘At the entrance to this lane half an hour ago,’
the stranger answered, scanning the dark surface of the
water anxiously. ‘I wanted to get as far as the brow
of the hill over yonder, but, as Davidson complained of
feeling tired, I set out alone. He said he would follow
me slowly and wait for me somewhere about here.
Did you by any chance hear a cry?’</p>

<p>“‘A cry!’ Delaney exclaimed. ‘A cry? No.
Did you?’</p>

<p>“‘I thought I did,’ the stranger said, moving away
from the edge of the water; ‘that is why I hurried
here. Perhaps he is somewhere about. Supposing we
call.’</p>

<p>“They shouted till they were hoarse, and the great
hills opposite hurled back the echoes of their voices, but
there was no other reply. Not a sign of Davidson.
At last the stranger touched Delaney on the arm.</p>

<p>“‘Come,’ he said with a shiver, ‘the night air is
cold. Davidson must have gone back to the inn, and
unless we make haste we shall be locked out. They go
to bed at eleven.’</p>

<p>“Very reluctantly Delaney gave up the search,
and the men were soon tramping along the road in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
silence—each apparently too pre-occupied with their
own thoughts to speak. Occasionally Delaney glanced
covertly at his companion, and whenever he did so,
he surprised the latter in the act of peeping cautiously
at him. Eventually the lights of Llanginney hove in
view, and several of the other visitors at the inn strolled
out to meet them.</p>

<p>“‘No, Davidson has not returned,’ was the reply to
their enquiries. ‘We have seen nothing of him since
you left. It’s not eleven yet, however; he has still
half an hour, and on such a night as this it would be
practically impossible to lose one’s way.’</p>

<p>“Delaney engaged his bed, and half an hour later, as
Davidson had not yet come back, he made his way
to the landlord’s private parlour. On the threshold
he met his recent companion.</p>

<p>“‘Who is he?’ he enquired of the landlord, directly
the door was closed, and he heard the stranger’s footsteps
echoing softly down the passage.</p>

<p>“‘Who is he?’ the landlord sleepily exclaimed.
‘Why, Mr. Hartney, a London lawyer. Quite a well-known
man in town, so I’m told. No, he has never
been here before, and as far as I’m aware he had never
met Mr. Davidson till to-day. Will I send someone to
look for Mr. Davidson? Why, that is what Mr. Hartney
has just asked me! No, sir, I have no one to send,’
and he spoke somewhat testily. ‘Some of my men
have gone—those who sleep out, and the rest are in
bed. I shall leave the door open. We aren’t afraid
of burglars in this part of the country. No, as I told
Mr. Hartney, there is no fear of the gentleman being
lost—he has gone a little further than he intended,
that is all.’ And the landlord yawned so emphatically
that Delaney beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>“‘I’m going to bed,’ he said, as he passed Hartney
in the hall. ‘The landlord assures me there is no fear
of any harm having befallen Davidson, and that he is
sure to turn up all right.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Do you think so?’ the lawyer queried.</p>

<p>“Delaney nodded.</p>

<p>“‘I know Davidson,’ he said; ‘I have known him
since boyhood. He is the least likely person in the
world to meet with mishap.’</p>

<p>“‘I am glad to hear you say so,’ Mr. Hartney responded.
‘Very glad. I fancied somehow—but there, it
must have only been fancy. Being intimately acquainted
with Mr. Davidson, you would of course know his voice,
and had he really called out, you would certainly have
heard him. It is doubtless a mere fancy on my part.
Good-night!’</p>

<p>“As Delaney wearily climbed the staircase and
peeped through the bannister, his eyes encountered
those of the lawyer steadily following him. Dog-tired,
he lost no time in undressing, but when he got into bed
he found sleep would not come to him. He lay first
on one side and then on the other, he tried not to think,
he resorted to every possible device, but it was all of
no avail. It was the pool, always the pool, the pool
and the blood-red tie. He kept seeing them before him,
and they continually bade him get out of bed and
come to them. At last, unable to resist them any
longer, he got up, and after slipping on his clothes,
stole noiselessly out into the still and narrow country
road.</p>

<p>“When he had gone a few yards, he thought he
heard a door shut behind him, but, on turning round
and perceiving no one, he attributed it to fancy and
went ahead at a brisk pace. At last, to his relief,
the pool came in view. There it was, just as he had
seen it, moon-kissed and silent, with the huge firs
shaking their heads ominously on the far side of it, and
the long line of glittering white wall casting its black
shadow on the grass and gorse, running away from it,
in an apparently interminable line, on the side nearest
him. It was a sight he knew he would never forget
as long as he lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Approaching the brink of the pool, he walked
slowly round it, peering anxiously into the water.
Suddenly he gave a start. Something white abruptly
bobbed to the surface. He looked closely at it, and
fancied he discerned a face. He was about to attach
a name to it, when he heard something behind him.
Swinging sharply round, he confronted Hartney.</p>

<p>“‘Good heavens! You here!’ he exclaimed.
‘Whatever brought you out at this time of night?’</p>

<p>“‘I might say the same to you,’ the lawyer replied.
‘What brought you here?’</p>

<p>“‘Davidson,’ Delaney said. ‘Do you know, I can’t
help associating him with this pool. It is damnably
fascinating.’</p>

<p>“‘I can’t help associating him with that cry,’ Hartney
remarked. ‘I am certain it was his voice! Good
God! what’s that?’ And he pointed frantically at
the white thing bobbing up and down in the water,
just where the moonbeams fell thickest, and not half a
dozen yards from where they stood.</p>

<p>“‘Where?’ Delaney said, pressing close to him
in a great state of excitement. ‘Where? Ah! I see
it now. It’s looking towards us. That—well, if you
wish to know what it is——’ He left off abruptly.
There was a wild scream, a heavy splash, and he continued
his sentence. ‘That, Mr. Hartney, is the solution
you seek to the mystery.’ And he went back to the
inn alone, chuckling.</p>

<p>“The sequel to this narrative comes as a surprise.
Hartney was not drowned. Being a very powerful
swimmer, and lightly clad, he got to the other side of
the pool, and, clambering up the bank, he wrung the
water from his clothes and ran all the way to the inn.
On arriving there, to his intense astonishment, he found
Davidson, safe and sound, and dressed in clothes two
or three sizes too small for him. Davidson’s experience
had been very similar to his own. Delaney had suddenly
seized him round the waist and hurled him into the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of the pool. There, he declared, he felt something like
very big and icy cold hands trying to pull him down.
He cried for help and prayed, and, as he prayed, the
hands relaxed their grasp, and he managed to struggle
safely to shore. The shock of what he had gone through,
however, was so great that he felt too ill to get back to
the inn, and he was compelled to rest awhile at a farm,
where he obtained a hot bath and a suit of clothes.
As Davidson knew Delaney’s wife and family, he begged
Hartney, for their sake, to keep the affair as secret as
possible.</p>

<p>“The doctor, who was called in to examine Delaney,
could not certify him as being actually insane. However,
he strongly recommended him to go into a private
home for a time, where he would be kept under constant
supervision, and Delaney did as the doctor advised.
But after being in the home about a month he escaped,
and was eventually found drowned in the lonely pool
near Llanginney.</p>

<p>“From the description given me of Delaney, I am
under the impression that the figure I saw in the mackintosh
was his ghost. But what about the figure
Hartney was positive he saw floating in the water?
Was it the phantom of someone who had perished
there, or had Davidson again unconsciously projected
himself? I incline to the latter. This is the case in
toto, and it was told to me by Hartney, who got all
the details, apart from those he had himself experienced,
direct from Davidson and Delaney.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="subt">I GO ON WITH THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE, AND NARRATE
A GHOSTLY HAPPENING IN LIVERPOOL</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">I gave</span> up acting directly I became engaged to be
married. I had no alternative, as my fiancée’s parents
strongly disapproved of the Stage, and so long as I
was on it, they would, I knew, never consent to my
union with their daughter. But it was rather a wrench,
for I really liked acting, and, with the exception of
the Sunday travelling, the life suited me well. What
other occupation to choose was a poser. All the difficulties
that had faced me on my return from the States
once again presented themselves, and were aggravated
by the fact that I was many years older. I was racking
my brain to know what to do for the best, when I
received a letter from an old friend in Cornwall, who
suggested that I should go down there and open up a
small Preparatory Boys’ School. It was Hobson’s
choice, and in due course of time I found myself once
again engaged in the profession I loathed. I started
with four or five pupils, and had worked up my connection
till I had nearly thirty, when someone, with more
money than I, set up on a much bigger scale, and my
numbers gradually decreased.</p>

<p>I was never an orthodox pedagogue; very much
the reverse. I aimed rather at making my pupils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
manly than at cramming their heads with book work,
and, I think, I succeeded. There were exceptions, of
course, but my pupils as a whole developed a fondness
for games, both cricket and football, that bore subsequent
fruit when they left me and went on the public
schools. The out-of-door occupation that formed part
of my life now was delightful, but the dry and dull
monotony of the schoolroom, and the eternal interference
of certain of the parents of my pupils, who wanted
everything for nothing, for my fees were ridiculously
small, took it out of me so much, that I simply longed
to throw up the whole thing and get back to my dearly-beloved
stage or writing.</p>

<p>It was while I was in Cornwall that I got my first
book, “For Satan’s Sake,” taken. Mr. Ranger Gull,
who was at that time reader for Mr. Arthur Greening’s
publishing house, read the MS., and was so pleased
with it, that he recommended it strongly for publication.
It was accepted, but did not appear in print for fully
a year.</p>

<p>“The Unknown Depths,” which I had written in
St. James’ Road, Brixton, followed; then “Jennie
Barlowe,” which I wrote between school hours in
Cornwall in the Spring of 1906; then “Dinevah the
Beautiful,” the last of my efforts in Brixton. The latter
appeared in 1907.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1908 my wife was ill, and in the
evenings, when my harassing duties in the schoolroom
were over, I used to sit by her bedside evolving
fresh plots. It was then that I first conceived the idea
of writing a ghost book.</p>

<p>In my holidays, which I usually spent in London or
the Midlands, never in Cornwall—I always flew away
from the precincts of the schoolroom the moment we
broke up—I had often gone ghost-hunting, and I now
determined to make use of my experiences. Consequently,
I mapped out a synopsis of a work on haunted
houses, which was at once accepted by Mr. Eveleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Nash, who commissioned me to write a book on those
lines. I did this in the Summer of 1908, and the book,
which appeared in the Autumn of that year and was
entitled “Some Haunted Houses of England and
Wales,” created something of a sensation. It was not
only extensively reviewed by the London papers, but
by many of the American and Colonial ones as well.
From that time onward my pen has rarely been idle,
and, apart from compiling some dozen or so works on
the Superphysical, I have written innumerable short
stories and articles. Indeed, so associated has my
name become with everything appertaining to the
psychic, that publishers are inclined to the idea that
I cannot write upon any other subject. In this, however,
I venture to think they are mistaken; for my
two works, “The Reminiscences of Mrs. E.&nbsp;M. Ward”
and “The Irish Abroad,” both published by Sir Isaac
Pitman &amp; Co., have been very favourably received by
both the Press and public.</p>

<p>It was, however, the success of this first work of
mine on ghostly phenomena that made me realise that
what I had long hoped for had at last come within
measurable distance of attainment. I could give up
teaching and devote my time once again, wholly and
solely to writing. Never shall I forget with what joy—with
what unbounded and infinite joy—I hailed the
prospect of leaving for ever behind me all those weary,
dreary hours in the schoolroom, where I had been
forced to display a patience I never had, and where I
had been forced to assume a virtue I never really
possessed, namely, a love of teaching.</p>

<p>I made public my intention of giving up the school
in the summer of 1908, and the following winter saw
me snugly ensconced in a little house in Upper Norwood,
where I have been ever since.</p>

<p>Several writers, one of whom I had the pleasure of
meeting in London quite recently (his brilliant character
studies of young and charming girls figure monthly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
certain of the popular magazines), have been credited
with introducing to the public, none too favourably,
this Cornish Colony amongst whom I lived. If they
have done so, I can certainly endorse their sentiments.
In no other town that I have been in have I ever met
people who laid themselves open to such unfavourable
criticism. I lived there nearly eight years, and during
that time I received the bare minimum of hospitality.
I found the greater number of the inhabitants bigoted
and pharisaical and the townfolk and labouring people
not only extremely ignorant, but very unforgiving and
vindictive. That they were still—that is to say, at
the time I am writing of—in a tribal state was proved
by their puerile attitude of hostility to strangers,
whom they used frequently to insult and annoy. I
signed two petitions relative to the throwing of stones
at visitors, which petitions were forwarded to the
Home Secretary. The result was nil. The local
authorities, in dealing with such cases, displayed the
most woeful apathy, and apparently this state of affairs
was irremediable, since the magistrates, with few exceptions,
were related to half the people in the town.</p>

<p>With the Art Colony I had very little to do. The
few artists I knew at all intimately I liked. I found
them congenial and generally sympathetic, though
displaying an avidity in criticising authors, which,
considering their touchiness with regard to any criticism
of their own work, was distinctly amusing; all the
same, apart from this and one other harmless peculiarity,
namely, an exaggerated and unblushing deference to
titles, I found them very good fellows, and nearly all
the hospitality I received in the town I received from
them.</p>

<p>I think I am right in saying there was never a very
friendly feeling between the townspeople and the
artists. The townspeople looked upon the artists as
intruders, “foreigners,” whose ways and habits were
diametrically opposite to theirs, especially with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to the treatment of the Sabbath; whilst the artists
showed a none too well concealed contempt for the
townspeople, whom they seemed to regard not only as
hopelessly inartistic, but of an utterly inferior breed.</p>

<p>In most small towns there is a good deal of unkind
gossip and scandal, but I really think that in this
respect the town I refer to was unrivalled. It seemed
to me that the people were never so happy as when
saying malicious things about each other, and they
meanly victimised those whose limited means would
not permit of their taking legal action against them.</p>

<p>I have often wondered what made these people so
peculiarly unkind.</p>

<p>As soon as I had settled down in Norwood, I wrote
“Ghostly Phenomena,” which was reviewed at length
by Andrew Lang in the “Morning Post.” About that
time I had the great pleasure of meeting Mrs. E.&nbsp;M.
Ward. The rencontre happened thus. The Misses
Enid and Beatrice Ward, Mrs. Ward’s youngest daughters,
were getting up some theatricals, and, being short
of a man, asked a lady, with whom I was acquainted,
if she knew of anyone who would help them out of
the difficulty. She wrote to me, with the result that
I took part in the play, and thus had the good fortune
to meet the Wards, with whom, I am happy to say, I
have kept in touch ever since.</p>

<p>A year or so afterwards I edited Mrs. Ward’s reminiscences,
which was, almost without exception, well
received by the Press. Some papers, “Vanity Fair”
and the “Weekly Graphic,” for instance—the “Graphic”
has always been very kind and fair to me,—giving the
book several lengthy and highly eulogistic notices.
Mrs. Ward is a believer in ghosts, and in her reminiscences
there is a very interesting first-hand experience
of hers with the Superphysical. Mrs. Ward’s children,
apart from the fact that they inherit talent from their
mother and father, and grandfather, their great-grandfather,
James Ward, R.A., and their great-great-uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
George Morland, R.A., are very interesting in themselves
and possess exceptional personal attractions.</p>

<p>A year after I first visited their house, I was commissioned
by the Editor of “The Weekly Despatch,”
Mr. Beuley, to write a series of ghostly experiences for
that paper. In order to do this I made pilgrimages to
all parts of the country, and in my zeal to find ghosts
occasionally encountered objects of a very different
nature. On one occasion, in Brighton, I had taken
advantage of a slightly open window to enter a tiny
house I had been told was very badly haunted. It was
a very dark night, and being unable to find my matches,
I had to grope my way about. I was in a room with
apparently never ending walls—they seemed to go
round and round without any outlet at all. At last,
however, I managed to discover a doorway, and, passing
through it, I felt my way to a staircase, which I climbed
up, till I came to what I judged to be a landing. There
all further speculations were brought to an abrupt
end by my suddenly falling over some large, soft object
on the floor. In an instant, there was a loud yell, and
I found myself rolling over and over clawing and
clutching at some foul and unsavoury mass, that seemed
to have fastened itself on to me with the intention of
first probing out my eyes, and then throttling me. The
small flask of whiskey that I happened to have on me
undoubtedly saved me from total annihilation. The
moment the claw-like hands touched the flask, I was
free.</p>

<p>I staggered to my feet, searched again, and, this
time, fortunately found the match-box and struck a
light.</p>

<p>Crouching on the floor in front of me was a long,
thin, scraggy creature with an absolutely bloodless face
and two big, round, protruding black eyes. Its hair
was matted like a mop and tossed about anywhere;
its clothes, or rather rags, were buttonless, and only
held together, here and there, by pieces of filthy string.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
A more disgusting, and at the same time pitiable,
spectacle could not be imagined.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for me that I had had previous
experience of such sights in the parks and commons of
London, otherwise I should have been terrified out of
my wits. As it was, I only just managed to pull myself
together, and realising that what I saw before me was
not a ghost, but a material and now, as far as I was
concerned, harmless being, I spoke to it.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “at any rate you seem to like my
whiskey. How long have you been here?”</p>

<p>The flask was gradually lowered, and a voice, which
I decided was that of a woman—for up to the present I
hadn’t been able to decipher its sex—gurgled, “I sleep
here every night. This is my house.”</p>

<p>“Then the enigma is solved,” I said. “You are the
ghost!”</p>

<p>“I soon shall be,” the creature replied, “for I’ve
eaten nothing for more than two days.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid I cannot give you any more than
this,” I said, “for it’s all I have with me.” And I
handed her some biscuits and bread and cheese.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the savage joy with which she
snatched the food from my hand and crammed it into
her big, gaping, fleshless jaws. No animal in the Zoo
was half so voracious. When she had finished it all, and
drained the last drop of whiskey, she drew her lean
and dirty, albeit well-shaped, fingers across her mouth,
and cursed me.</p>

<p>“Get you gone,” she snarled, “and leave me here.
I tell you this is my house. I’ve as much right to it
as you or anyone else. Get you gone, or I’ll spit at
you.” And not wishing to be spat upon, I picked up
my flask and departed.</p>

<p>I encountered another ghost of this order three
nights later in a house in Manchester. The house
was furnished, but was untenanted, as the owner, a
rich and eccentric old lady, believed it to be haunted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
She wrote to me, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">àpropos</i> of my book, “Ghostly
Phenomena,” and suggested I should try and exorcise
the ghost. Now I do not altogether believe in exorcism.
There are occasions upon which it has been practised
with success, mostly in cases of haunting by phantasms
of the sane dead, but there are also many cases, within
my own experience, in which it has been practised with
no result whatever.</p>

<p>At all events, with my elastic views regarding denominational
religion, I did not feel disposed to try it, and
so I wrote and told her. She replied, “Come in any
case, and give me your opinion as to the nature and
cause of the phenomena.”</p>

<p>I went. The house was in a quiet, sleepy thoroughfare,
not three minutes walk from the Whalley Road. It
was big and roomy, and would have been attractive
but for the walls, the papers of which had obviously
been chosen by someone who did not possess even the
most elementary conception of what is pleasing in
colour and design. As it was, my artistic susceptibilities
were so grossly outraged, that I could well have imagined,
the place haunted by neutrarians of the most undesirable
order.</p>

<p>I visited the house in the early evening, and the
subdued light from the fast-fading sunshine, filtering
through the drawn Venetian blinds, produced a singularly
sad, and, at the same time, ghostly effect. I had come
unaccompanied, for nothing on earth would persuade
the old lady or any of her domestics to set a foot in the
house, and as I wandered through room after room,
the intense hush began at length to tell on my nerves.
When I was on the staircase leading to the top storey,
I fancied I heard a slight noise, and a sudden faintness
coming over me, I had to clutch hold of the banisters
to prevent myself falling. I went on, however, and
opening a door at the top of the stairs, found myself
in a large room communicating with two other rooms
by means of doors, both of which stood slightly ajar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
I had passed through the first, and was half across
the floor of the second, when I suddenly felt one of
my ankles caught hold of. The shock was so great
that all the blood in my body seemed suddenly to dry
up, and again I all but fainted. Forcing myself to
look down, however, I perceived a skinny hand and
arm protruding from under the dressing-table, and
assured by the appearance of it that it belonged to
nothing ghostly, I struck at it with my stick, kicking
out vigorously at the same time.</p>

<p>With terrible howlings there now crawled from under
the table a long and lanky idiot boy. It transpired
that he was the son of one of the old lady’s servants,
and that he was enjoying a nice, comfortable home at
her expense. His mother used to visit him every
evening, and this evening he had hidden under the
table with the intention of frightening her. Unfortunately
for them both, however, he had frightened
me instead. The servant, of course, lost her post,
and the old lady, assured that there was no longer
any fear of ghosts, came back to the house, and, at
my suggestion, had all the walls re-papered.</p>

<p>The following week I had another rather strange
experience in Liverpool. I was getting dozens of letters
weekly at that time, as the first of my series of ghost
stories had appeared in the “Weekly Despatch,”
and my fame as a spook hunter had spread far and
wide in consequence. A lady in Liverpool wrote to
me, saying that her daughter, Emily, was tormented
by a man coming into her bedroom every night at
the same time and walking off with her bedclothes.
He said nothing, merely opened her door, and, approaching
the bed on tip-toe, caught hold of the clothes and
hurriedly retreated with them. Spirit lights, my correspondent
added, were constantly seen in the room, and
at times figures like angels, and she would be glad if I
would visit the house, and discover for her, if possible,
some explanation of the occurrences. The nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
manifestations being somewhat extraordinary, I thought
it discreet to take a friend. The house was in a crescent,
close to Clayton Square. We were shown into the
drawing-room, where all the family were assembled,
and we were at once regaled with detailed accounts of
all that was alleged to happen. Then we were taken
to the bedroom that was haunted, and the young lady
whose bed the ghost stripped, at our request, sat there
with us. As soon as the electric light was switched
off, she began to see spirit lights. We saw nothing.
No man appeared, and, on taking our departure, we
both agreed that the phenomena were subjective, and
that it was simply a case of hallucination. Accordingly,
I advised her mother to consult a good general practitioner,
as, in all probability, her daughter needed a
tonic and change of air. I strongly warned her against
consulting any professional Spiritualist.</p>

<p>Well, I returned to London, and thought no more
of the matter till the following Christmas, when, quite
by chance, I ran against a young doctor, to whom I
had mentioned the incident. Evidently eager to communicate
something, he remarked, “You remember that
Liverpool case you told me about—the case of the
young lady whose bedclothes used to disappear, and
which you thought was hallucination? Well, you
were mistaken. Since I saw you, I have become acquainted
with the doctor who attends her, and he
told me that, whilst he was there one day, the bedroom
door opened and in walked a young man. He says
the girl immediately exclaimed, ‘Here is the man
who haunts my room at night. For goodness sake,
Doctor, do something!’ Whereupon, the man, muttering
some words in German, abruptly left the room.
My doctor friend immediately ran after him, but he
was nowhere to be seen, and although the house was
at once searched, no traces of him could be found.
Now, what do you think of the case?”</p>

<p>“It is certainly a very unusual one,” I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
“and, as you say, this sequel quite upsets my theory
of hallucination. It may be a case of projection.
Someone who knows the girl and wishes to torment
her is experimenting in visiting her in his immaterial
ego. I have heard of similar cases.”</p>

<p>“But she knows no one like him,” my friend responded.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” I said. “The image she sees may
be, and very likely is, merely an assumed one. Does
she know any Indians, or anyone who is an earnest
student of the occult? Find out if you can.”</p>

<p>I have not yet heard from my friend, but I still incline
to the idea that the ghost in this case was a phantasm
of the living, rather than a phantasm of the dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="subt">SOME STRANGE CASES IN BIRMINGHAM, HARROGATE,
SUSSEX AND NEWCASTLE</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> I was still writing for “The Weekly Despatch,”
I happened to visit an old friend of mine, a Captain
Rupert Tennison, who was staying with an aged relative
in the Hagley Road, Birmingham.</p>

<p>“This is hardly the house you would expect to see
a ghost in, is it?” he remarked to me after luncheon.
“And yet I can assure you I had a very remarkable
psychic experience here, in this very room. I’ve often
wanted to tell you about it. It happened one New
Year’s Eve three and a half years ago. My aunt had a
nephew, on her husband’s side, called Jack Wilmot, and
he and I used to meet here regularly at the commencement
of every New Year. On this occasion, however,
my aunt informed me that Wilmot was unable to
be present, as he was detained in Mexico, where he
had a very good post as a mining engineer.</p>

<p>“I was much disappointed, for Wilmot and I were
great pals, and the prospect of staying here alone
with the old lady struck me as perfectly appalling.
I resolved to make the best of it, however, for I was
genuinely sorry for my aunt, whom I could see was
quite as disappointed as I was. I arrived late in the
afternoon of December 31st. We dined at seven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
at nine my aunt went off to bed and left me in this
room by myself.</p>

<p>“For some time I read—no, not one of your books,
O’Donnell—a Guy Maupassant; but the light being
rather bad, and my eyes tired, for I had been travelling
all the previous night, I was at last obliged to desist
and devote myself entirely to a pipe.</p>

<p>“The servants went to bed at about ten. I heard
them tap respectfully at my aunt’s door on their way,
and wish her good-night. After that the house was
absolutely silent, so silent, indeed, that the hush began
to get on my nerves, and I was contemplating retiring
also, when heavy footsteps suddenly crossed the hall and
the door of this room was flung wide open. I looked round
in amazement. Standing on the threshold was Wilmot.</p>

<p>“‘Why, Jack!’ I cried. ‘I am glad to see you,
old fellow. Your aunt told me you could not come.
How did you manage it?’</p>

<p>“‘Quite easily,’ he said in the light, careless manner
which was one of his characteristics. ‘Where there’s a
will, there’s a way, you know. I’ve taken French leave.’</p>

<p>“‘Taken French leave!’ I ejaculated. ‘Then there’ll
be the deuce to pay when you get back. Anyhow,
that’s your affair, not mine. You’ll have some supper?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ he said; ‘I had a very good meal a short
time ago, and I’m not the least bit hungry. We will
chat instead.’</p>

<p>“He pulled his chair up to the table, and, leaning
his elbows on it, stared right into my face.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t look very well, Jack,’ I said. ‘Maybe
this strong light has something to do with it, but you
are as pale as a sheet. Is it the voyage?’</p>

<p>“‘Not altogether,’ he replied. ‘I’ve had a lot of
trouble lately.’</p>

<p>“‘Tell me,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘Won’t it bore you?’ he replied. ‘After all, why
should I bother other people with my woes. Oh, all
right, I will if you like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Some months ago there came to the town where
I am working a wealthy Spaniard and his wife. Their
name was Hervada. He was a tall, lean, sour-faced
old curmudgeon, and she one of the most beautiful
young creatures you can imagine. You can guess what
happened?’</p>

<p>“‘You fell in love with her, of course,’ I cried.</p>

<p>“‘From the moment I saw her,’ Jack replied.</p>

<p>“‘You got introduced,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘Trust me,’ he laughed. ‘I found out where she
lived, and the rest was so easy that before the end of
the week I had dined with them, and also had had
one clandestine meeting in the Park. At first her old
villain of a husband suspected nothing. But it is
infernally hard to keep up a pretence for long, when
one is really madly consumed with passion. Eyes are
sure indicators of what the heart feels, at least mine
are, and when Hervada suddenly looked up and caught
me gazing at his wife as if I could devour her, the cat
was completely out of the bag. I give him credit for
one thing, however: he took it very calmly. Despite
his unprepossessing exterior he could at times be extremely
courteous and dignified.</p>

<p>“‘You will oblige me by settling this matter in
the way customary to gentlemen in this country,’
he said. ‘You must remember you are not in England
now; you are in Mexico. Have you a revolver?’</p>

<p>“‘I am never without one,’ I replied.</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ he observed, ignoring the intervention of
his wife, whose apprehensions were only too plainly
more on my account than on his, ‘we will step on to
the verandah.’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ I said. ‘You don’t mean to say you
actually fought a duel?’</p>

<p>“Jack nodded. ‘Yes!’ he said. ‘We measured off
twenty paces, and then, turning round, fired.’</p>

<p>“‘And you killed him?’</p>

<p>“‘That would be your natural surmise,’ was the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
‘But you are mistaken. It was I who was killed.’</p>

<p>“The moment he had said these words, he seemed
to fade away, and before I could recover from my
astonishment, he had completely disappeared, and I
found myself staring not at him but the blank wall.
And now comes the oddest part of it. I naturally
expected to hear Jack was dead. I said nothing to my
aunt, but I wrote off to his address at once.</p>

<p>“Judge, then, of my relief when I received a letter
from him by return of post to say he was absolutely
fit and well, and getting on splendidly. That was in
February. In the following August my aunt wrote to
me saying a very tragic occurrence had taken place.
Jack was dead. He had been found on the verandah
of an hotel in Mexico shot through the heart. Though
the identity of his murderer was generally suspected,
there was no actual proof, and as the man was very
rich and influential, it was thought quite useless to
take up the case. Now what kind of superphysical
phenomenon do you call that?” Captain Tennison
concluded.</p>

<p>“I can’t exactly say,” I replied. “It is one of
those strange prognostications of the future that happen
more often on New Year’s Eve than on any other day
of the year.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the phantasm you saw was actually
Wilmot’s spirit. I don’t see how it could have been.
I think it was an impersonating neutrarian, one of that
order of phantasms that have never inhabited any
kind of material body, and whose special function is
apparently to foretell the end of certain people, and
certain people only.”</p>

<p>When I had finished my articles for “The Weekly
Despatch,” which I was writing in alternation with
“The Reminiscences of Mrs. E.&nbsp;M. Ward,” I took a
brief holiday, visiting for the first time Matlock and
Harrogate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Learning that there was an alleged haunted house
in the latter town, I sought, and managed to obtain,
permission to spend a night in it. It was a modern
edifice of a great height, situated about ten minutes
walk from St. James’ Hall.</p>

<p>I went there alone, and, on entering the premises,
encountered an almost death-like air of stillness, which
contrasted oddly with the world outside, where all was
life and gaiety. But a moment before I had mixed
with the streams of ultra-fashionable people heading
for the Spa Concert, the Theatre, and the Valley Park,
and, so free had they seemed from all trouble and
responsibility—so full of sparkling, spontaneous fun
and flippancy—and above all, so full of the flamboyant
spirit of sheer life, that one could not help feeling, as
one looked at them, that after all there could be no
such thing as death for them—that such pronounced
vitality must go on for ever.</p>

<p>But this house—this forsaken house, void of furniture,
of everything, save the soft summer evening sunlight,
the shadows, and my presence—how different! Wandering
from room to room, and floor to floor, I at length
completed my preliminary search, and being somewhat
tired, I sat down on the floor of the hall, and, taking a
newspaper from my pocket, started reading. As the
hours passed by and darkness came on, I began to
be afraid. No amount of experience in ghost hunting
will ever enable me to overcome that awful, hideous
fear that seizes me when I see the last glimmer of
daylight fade, and I realise I am about to be brought
into contact with the superphysical, and that I must
face it—alone.</p>

<p>Noises in empty houses I have noticed usually commence
in the basement, and I was not at all surprised
when presently I heard a faint tapping proceeding
from one of the kitchens. This was followed by a long
spell of silence, and then one of the stairs creaked.
My heart gave a big thump, and I gazed expectantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
into the darkness before me, but there was nothing to
be seen. Silence again, and then more tapping, and
more creaking. Something then tickled my hand,
and a moment later my fingers touched a blackbeetle.
In an instant I was on my feet, for I dread beetles
more than I dread ghosts, and, on my striking a light,
I found the whole floor swarming. I wondered very
much at this, because beetles do not as a rule frequent
houses that have been empty for any length of time,
especially in a climate like that of Harrogate. I have
since, however, arrived at the conclusion that where
there are hauntings, there are, more often than not,
plagues of beetles, but whether attracted by the ghost,
or not, I cannot say.</p>

<p>As I could no longer tolerate the idea of remaining
in the hall in the dark, I lighted four candles, and,
placing them on the floor, sat in the midst of them.</p>

<p>It was only eleven o’clock by my watch, and the
idea of keeping up my vigil till the morning did not
strike me as particularly pleasant. I took up my paper
and again began to read. Half an hour or so passed,
and then I received a start. A door opened and shut
downstairs, and bare footsteps pattered their way along
the stone passage and up the wooden stairs.</p>

<p>The nearer they drew, the more intolerable became
my suspense. What should I see? A white-faced,
glassy-eyed phantasm of the dead, or some blood-curdling,
semi-human, semi-animal neutrarian. Which
would it be? I confess I would have given all I possessed
to be out in the road, but, as is usually the case with
me when in the presence of the superphysical, I was
quite powerless to speak or move. Then, to my unfeigned
astonishment, instead of anything grotesque and
awful, there appeared before me a little fair-haired girl,
clad in a much-soiled pinafore and without either shoes
or stockings.</p>

<p>Though not actually crying, she appeared in great
distress, and feeling around on all sides, as if anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
searching for someone, she ran past me, and commenced
to ascend the stairs. Picking up a candle, I followed
her, and, as the patterings of her poor, chilled feet
spread their echoes far and wide through the vast
deserted house, I thought I had never experienced
anything half so pathetic. On and on we went, the
little thin legs leading the way, till we reached the top
storey, when she ran into a room facing me, and slammed
the door. I immediately followed, but the room was
quite empty. There were no signs of the child; there
was only a particularly vivid beam of moonlight, and
a virile and overwhelming atmosphere of sadness.</p>

<p>During the next few days I was told a story that fully
accounted for the hauntings.</p>

<p>It appears that about thirty years before my visit
to the house a little girl had lived there with her father
and step-mother. Her nurse, to whom she was very
much attached, being summarily dismissed by her
step-mother, she became ill, and very soon died, so it
was rumoured, of a broken heart.</p>

<p>Shortly after her death the house was to let, and no
tenant, I found out, has ever occupied it since for very
long.</p>

<p>I have often wished that I had spoken to the sad
little spirit, but I was too fascinated by it, and too
much engaged watching its movements, to think of
anything else. And I have found that this same fascination
and preoccupation have prevented me from trying
to communicate with the ghost in nearly all the cases
of haunting that I have ever investigated. On the few
occasions that I have spoken to a phantasm, I have
received no reply, no indication even that it has heard
me.</p>

<p>In a very famous haunted house in the West of
England, during my investigations which were spread
over a period of nine, not uninterruptedly consecutive,
nights, manifestations took place twice, and on both
occasions I stood up and spoke, but in neither case was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
there any response whatever. This same ghost had been
subjected to exorcism by a well-known ecclesiast, but,
far from being exorcised, the ghost so scared his exorciser
that he all but fainted. These demonstrations were
visual. In a haunted house that I was asked to visit
in Sussex I saw nothing, but heard knockings, and by
means of them tried, though without success, to establish
a code. I heard of the case in this way.</p>

<p>A young lady, whom I will call Miss Hemming, wrote
to me. She and her mother occupied a modern and
picturesquely situated house at the foot of the Downs,
and were very frequently disturbed, she said, between
nine and ten in the evening, by sounds, such as might
be made with a muffled hammer, on the wall of her
mother’s room. Simultaneously the figure of a young
man moved noiselessly across the lawn, from the
direction of a swing. He usually approached her window
and came to a halt immediately beneath it. He had
never replied when spoken to. She had fired at him
several times, but the bullets had had no effect whatever.
It seemed as if they had passed right through
him, because he still stood there, whilst the gravel
was splattered up immediately behind him. On one
or two occasions he shone a bicycle lamp on his face,
so that she could distinctly see his features. It was
the face of no one she knew, though she fancied it bore
a close resemblance to a notorious murderer, whose
photos had been in the papers, and who had expiated
his crime on the gallows. These were not the only
manifestations. Stones had been repeatedly thrown at
Mrs. Hemming, and, although the house was being
closely watched by the police, the stone-throwing still
went on, and so far the culprit had not even been seen,
let alone caught.</p>

<p>I visited the house once by myself, and once with a
party of men. On the former occasion I hid in a little
copse at the furthest extremity of the lawn, and watched
the house and swing closely, but I neither heard nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
saw anything. Returning to the house, I was told by
Miss Hemming that both she and her mother had
heard the knockings, and that she herself had, at
the same time, seen the figure on the lawn.</p>

<p>On the occasion of my second visit, we all heard the
knockings on the wall of Mrs. Hemming’s room, and
one of us, who was looking out of her daughter’s window,
saw what he fancied were two shadows of human beings
cross the moonlit lawn and vanish in the direction of
a hedge. Trickery was practically impossible, as the
garden was protected on all sides by barbed wire, and
there were on the premises four or five dogs, including
a young bloodhound. We had of course made a thorough
search of the house and grounds previously.</p>

<p>One or two other incidents happened during the
night. When I was in the hall alone, a light, as from a
bicycle lamp, was suddenly shone in my face, apparently
from a blank wall, and when we were all seated in
front of the dining-room fire, we heard heavy footsteps
cross the hall, and although we ran out at once we
could see no one. We were shown the stones that were
alleged to have been thrown, but none were thrown
whilst we were there. They were a peculiar kind of
flint, which certainly did not belong to the neighbourhood.
Mrs. Hemming had several times narrowly
escaped being hit by them, and one had crashed through
the bedroom window as she was looking out of it.</p>

<p>I did not continue my investigation of the case,
because there were certain features in connection with
it of a private and family nature, which greatly added
to its complexity, and which would, of necessity, have
rendered any attempt at solution incomplete and
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Cases of complex haunting, although, for obvious
reasons, seldom admitting of any satisfactory explanation,
always interest me the most. Here is one I chanced
to hit upon in Newcastle.</p>

<p>A house in —— Street had stood empty for seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
or eight years, and on my making enquiries about it,
I was told to apply to a Mr. Black, the last tenant.
I did so, and Mr. Black very kindly gave me a detailed
account of what had taken place there during his
tenancy. It was as <span class="nobreak">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“A day or two after our arrival I happened to be
going upstairs, and, as I passed by one of the bedrooms,
the door of which was slightly open, I glanced
in, and saw the figure of a lady, whom I had never
seen before. She was dressed in green, and standing
in front of the looking-glass, engaged apparently in
putting on her hat. Wondering who on earth she
could be, for I knew the room had not been slept in,
I spoke to her, and receiving no reply, I was advancing
towards her, when she suddenly disappeared. I did
not know what to make of the affair, but, thinking
that possibly it was an hallucination, I resolved to
think no more of it, and to say nothing about it to any
of my family or household.</p>

<p>“Some days later, however, when out walking with
my wife, I met a friend who asked me where I was
living. I told him, and he exclaimed excitedly:</p>

<p>“‘Good gracious, not in that house! Why, my dear
fellow——’ At a sign from me he stopped. I had guessed
what was coming, and as my wife is extremely nervous I
thought it best she should not hear what I knew he
was going to say, namely, that the house was haunted.</p>

<p>“That night I went round to see my friend. He
made no bones about it; he told me that the house
I had taken was haunted—that he knew it for a fact.</p>

<p>“‘Some months ago,’ he said, ‘I was thinking of
taking it myself, and, obtaining the key from the agent,
went to look over it. It was quite light, not more than
five o’clock in the afternoon, and the house seemed
bright and cheerful. Closing the front door carefully
behind me, I commenced a tour of the premises. I
had reached the top floor, and was standing in the
centre of one of the rooms, when I heard a slight noise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I started, and, turning round in the direction from
which the sound came, perceived a lady and a little
girl standing in the doorway watching me. There
was nothing at all remarkable about them. The lady
was dressed in green, the child in white, both modern,
or at least comparatively modern, costumes. I was
so surprised at their being there, however, as I knew
I had shut the hall door, that I simply stood and stared
at them. Then something much more extraordinary
happened—they vanished. It was not an hallucination—that
I can swear to—and thoroughly scared, I tore
downstairs and out of the house. After this I gave
up all idea of taking the place, and I can’t help feeling
sorry, old fellow, that you’ve taken it.’</p>

<p>“In spite of this warning,” Mr. Black continued,
“I did not give up the house immediately. After we
had been there a week or so, a cousin of mine came
to stay with us; and one evening he and one of my
children, who were in the drawing-room, together heard
a soft, cautious whistle—as if someone were giving a
signal, coming, they thought, from just behind them.
The whistle was repeated, and a few minutes later
they heard a loud cry, half human, half animal, and
wholly ominous. My cousin pretended it was one of
the servants, but my child would not be convinced,
and begged to be taken to bed at once, as she dared
not remain in the room any longer. After this, phenomena
of all kinds happened; steps used to be heard
bounding up and down the stairs at all hours of the
night; one of the maids declared she saw something
that was a man and yet not a man come out of the
drawing-room with a run, and race up the staircase
two or three steps at a time; heavy pantings and
sighs were heard, and several of the household were
awakened by a cold hand being laid upon their face.
But I think the most remarkable thing that happened
is this:—I was sitting in my study one evening, when
the maid rapped at my door and said that a clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
(whom she had shown into the drawing-room) wished
to see me on some very urgent matter. I at once put
down the book I was reading, and, hastening to the
drawing-room, found it empty. Wondering what had
become of the clergyman, I was about to ring the bell
to enquire, when I suddenly caught sight of a large
eye, human in shape and horribly sinister, glaring at me
from behind an arm-chair. I was so frightened that
I could do nothing but stare back at it, and then, to my
intense relief, my wife entered the room with a friend,
and the phenomenon disappeared.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill8"></a>
<img src="images/ill8.jpg" width="439" height="627" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>“I suddenly caught sight of a large eye”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“And the parson?” I observed.</p>

<p>“I never heard anything more of him,” Mr. Black
remarked. “The maid assured me on her honour that
she had shown him into the room, but no one saw him
leave the house, so he, too, might have been a ghost;
but supposing him to have been a living person, his
disappearance would not be unnatural. He had doubtless
seen the eye and precipitated himself into the street
through the open window.</p>

<p>“The following day, my children being badly frightened
by something in one of the passages, I decided
to leave the house; and, although I afterwards made
every possible enquiry, I could never hear of anything
particularly tragic that had ever happened there.
We were the first tenants, so I was told, that had ever
complained of disturbances, and it was suggested that
we might have brought the ghosts with us, but as none
of us had ever seen a ghost before we entered that
house, and we had no old furniture, at least none that
we had not always had, and not one of us had ever
attended a séance or in any way dabbled with Spiritualism,
I do not think that theory at all possible. How
do you account for the hauntings?”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” I replied, “nor can anyone else. The
sheer complexity of such a case renders any definite
conclusion with regard to it extremely difficult, and
any positive solution of it utterly out of the question.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="subt">WAR GHOSTS</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Of</span> late years the increase of interest taken in things
psychical, particularly among the more educated classes,
the classes that were at one time incorrigibly sceptical,
has been enormous. I believe this to be mainly due
to the fact that people are no longer satisfied with
the scriptural declaration of another world. They want
proof of it—that is to say, absolutely authentic and
corroborative evidence that it exists—and they feel that
they can only obtain such evidence by witnessing
superphysical manifestations themselves. Psychical
Research Societies, perhaps, convince them even less
than the Bible. And naturally, for the scientist, even
though he be titled, can hardly hope to accomplish in
one generation what theologians, of an equal if not
superior intelligence, have attempted and failed to
accomplish throughout the ages. Hence, I am of the
opinion that one can learn more from one spontaneous
ghostly manifestation in a haunted house than from a
thousand lectures, or a thousand books. Experience
is the only medium of conviction, and so long as people
are without a personal experience relating to another
world, they can never really believe. The boy in rags
and tatters may be far more conversant with—may
know far more about—a future life than the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
learned Professor at the University. But no one can
logically claim to be an absolute authority on the
Unknown; the most any of us can do—even those of
us who have actually seen and heard spirit manifestations—the
rest do not count—is to speculate. When we
attempt to do more, we label ourselves fools.</p>

<p>Of all the professions, none, I believe, is more interested
in this question of another world than the theatrical.
I have a great many friends amongst actors and
actresses, and I find them not only keenly interested
in my work, but always ready—even when working
hard themselves—to share my vigils in a haunted house.</p>

<p>Only the other day, at a concert given by the Irish
Literary Society in Hanover Square, I was introduced
to Miss Odette Goimbault, who recently delighted
London audiences by her impersonation of the child
“Doris” in “On Trial” at the Lyric Theatre. Odette
Goimbault is unquestionably pretty—but there is much
in her looks besides mere prettiness. She has eyes
that are extraordinarily spiritual, eyes that seem to
look right into the soul of things and see things that
are not generally seen by ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>When a very small child, Odette Goimbault lived
with her mother in a house at Thornton Heath. A lady
died of consumption in the flat immediately beneath
Mrs. Goimbault’s, and after the burial, Odette, though
previously very fond of staying up late, used, every
night, precisely at seven o’clock, to beg her mother
to take her upstairs to bed, declaring, in a great state
of terror and with tears in her eyes, that she saw an
old man with only one leg standing in a corner of the
room shaking his stick at her. When once she was
taken out of the room her fears subsided.</p>

<p>In my opinion she is an ideal young actress for the
pourtrayal of soul, for the transmittal of a sense of
soul to the audience, and I think there is no one, either
on the stage or off it, who looks more in touch with
the spiritual world than Odette Goimbault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>But stronger even than its hold upon the theatrical
profession is the stand that psychism has taken with
regard to the present war.</p>

<p>Ever since the fighting began I have heard speculations
raised as to whether our soldiers at the Front have
been witnessing ghostly manifestations or not. So far,
I must own that I have elicited very little reliable
evidence on this point, but the circumstances have
established at least one interesting fact, and that is,
that to the man in the street the question of another
world has at last become a matter of some importance.</p>

<p>The wife of a very eminent official at the War Office
told me a few weeks ago that officers who took part in
the Dardanelles Expedition assured her that figures
believed to be ghosts were on several occasions seen
gliding over the ground after an engagement, especially
where the dead bodies of the Turks lay thickest. The
same lady also told me that when a certain regiment
formed up after a brilliant charge, in which it had
suffered very severe casualties, some of the gaps in the
ranks were observed to be filled by shadowy forms—forms
which disappeared the moment anyone attempted
to touch them.</p>

<p>Neither my informant nor any of the soldiers from
the Front that I have met have been able to give me
any information as to the alleged superphysical demonstrations
in the sky during the retreat from Mons.
But I should like to record here, in connection with the
war, a case I heard in Paris. I published an account
of it in the November, 1915, number of “The Occult
Review,” and now reproduce it through the courtesy
of Mr. Ralph Shirley:</p>

<p>“The mention of Ferdinand of Bulgaria brings
vividly back to my memory two stories I heard about
him, when I was dining one evening in June, 1914, at
the renowned Henriette’s Restaurant in Montparnasse.
Two men were seated at a table close beside me, and I
eventually got into conversation with them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
informed me they were journalists, and that their
names were Guilgaut and Bonivon respectively.</p>

<p>“‘You would laugh, if you knew where I spent last
night,’ I observed. ‘I was in an alleged haunted flat
in Montrouge. I don’t suppose either of you believes
in ghosts?’</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ Guilgaut said. ‘I have had more than one
experience with an apparition in my life, and so has
my friend.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ chimed in Bonivon, ‘we have good cause
to remember ghosts, since we stayed six weeks in a
haunted hotel in Bucharest, and never had such an
infernally uncomfortable time either before or since.
We never saw the ghost ourselves, but one of the other
lodgers declared he did, and used to wake us every
other night by the most unholy screams.’</p>

<p>“They then talked a lot about their adventures
in the Balkans, and finally alluded to Ferdinand of
Bulgaria. ‘If ever a man is haunted, he is,’ Guilgaut
remarked. ‘I believe he never leaves his room at night
without the shadow of Stambuloff, whose death he
brought about in 1895. It simply steps out from the
wall and follows him.’</p>

<p>“‘That is a lot of exaggeration,’ Bonivon said with
a laugh. ‘But, quite seriously, we heard on very
excellent authority that on more than one occasion a
figure has been seen accompanying Ferdinand sometimes
when dining and sometimes when walking, and
that it has been recognised by the spectators as Stambuloff,
the dead Minister. Once, we were told, Ferdinand
visited a certain Princess, and it was remarked that
Her Royal Highness appeared strangely embarrassed and
perturbed. At last someone ventured to enquire of the
lady-in-waiting, who also appeared to be greatly perturbed,
what was the matter. “It’s that man,” was
the whispered reply, “that man who persists in standing
beside His Majesty. He never takes his eyes from our
faces, and he looks just like a corpse.” Her interrogator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
asked her to describe the figure, which he said was
quite invisible to him.</p>

<p>“‘She did so, and the description tallied exactly with
that of Stambuloff.’</p>

<p>“‘Tell him about Ferdinand and the fortune-teller,’
Guilgaut said.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, that happened when we were staying close
to his Kohary estates,’ Bonivon responded. ‘Ferdinand
is notoriously sly and mean, and one day, as he was
passing through the village where we were staying, he
chanced to encounter a charming Hungarian maiden,
who eked out a very precarious livelihood hawking
ribbons and telling fortunes. Ferdinand had his hand
read, and, thinking to trap the girl, disguised himself
and went to her again the following evening. To his
astonishment, although the make-up was skilful, for
Ferdinand is a born actor in more senses than one, the
girl recognised him at once as the gentleman who had
been to her the previous evening. “I was expecting
you,” she said. “Expecting me?” Ferdinand stammered.
“How is that? I’ve told no one.” “Oh, fie!”
the girl remonstrated, shaking her finger at him. “The
gentleman who accompanied you last night came here
himself an hour ago and told me you were coming.”
“What was he like?” Ferdinand asked, shaking all
over. “Like,” the girl retorted pertly. “Why, you
know as well as I do,” and she rattled off a description
of the man, which tallied exactly with that of the dead
Stambuloff, whom, by-the-way, Guilgaut and I had
seen many scores of times in the early eighties. “Your
friend,” the girl continued, “left a message for you.
He said—tell him when he comes that he will perish
in very much the same manner as I have done; and he
showed me his hand.” “And what did you see?”
Ferdinand asked. “I saw the same ending to the
life line in his hand as I see in yours,” the girl
replied. “Why, there is your friend! He is beckoning
to you. You had better go to him.” And, to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
astonishment, Ferdinand walked off in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>“‘We had the story first hand. She told it us two
or three days afterwards, and expressed great anxiety
as to the identity of the two men who had behaved so
strangely to her.’”</p>

<p>Only one case of haunting at the actual Front has
been related to me. I will state it in my own words.</p>

<p>It happened during the retreat from N——.</p>

<p>The O——’s had suffered heavily, and, in the scramble
to get out of the deadly fire zone, small parties of them,
owing to the nature of the country, had got isolated
from the main body and left behind. This was the case
with a dozen or so men of B Company, who, after racing
across a field amid a hail of shrapnel, had clambered
over a formidable barrier of barbed wire into a dense wood.</p>

<p>Under cover of a thick cluster of trees they sat down
and doctored their wounds. There was not a sound
man amongst them. Sergeant Mackay had been struck
in three places in his right leg; Corporal MacIntyre
had had a good square inch of flesh taken off his thigh;
Private Findlay had lost three of his fingers; and
Bugler Scott—an ear; while, in addition to these slight
inconveniences, they were all ravenously hungry and
parched with thirst.</p>

<p>“I suggest,” said Sergeant Mackay, after a brief lull
in their conversation, “that we push on again and see
if we can find some sort of habitation where we can
get a mouthful.”</p>

<p>“Aye, mon!” Corporal MacIntyre replied, for during
such “sauve qui peuts” all formality of rank is dropped,
“It’s the wee drappie I’m thinking after, and unless we
get some of it pretty soon there’ll not be any of us left
to need it. I’m bleeding like a pig, and so are a good
many more of us.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” Sergeant Mackay observed, rising
with difficulty, and wincing in spite of his efforts to
appear comfortable. “Let us press on.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The men were all absolutely ignorant of their surroundings.
They had seen nothing of the country save from
the train, and during a few hours’ tramp from the
railway depot to the lines they had just evacuated.
Consequently, for all they knew to the contrary, the
wood that lay in front of them might stretch for miles,
or might be inhabited by anything from grizly bears
to hyænas—for the knowledge of the British “Tommy”
with regard to the fauna and flora of Belgium is extremely
limited.</p>

<p>Threading their way through the thick undergrowth,
they stole stealthily forward, the roar of artillery still
sounding faintly in their ears, till at length they emerged
into a wide clearing, at the far extremity of which stood
a neatly thatched white cottage. It was so home-like
with its small plot of flower-bedecked garden, its walls
covered with clematis and honeysuckle, and its tiny
spiral column of smoke curling heavenwards, that the
bleeding and exhausted men gave deep sighs of relief.</p>

<p>“Reminds me of Scotland,” Private Findlay whispered.</p>

<p>“It’s as like my mother’s cottage as two peas,”
Private Callum retorted.</p>

<p>They halted, and were looking at Sergeant Mackay
to see what he would do—for bold as the O——’s are in
battle, they are often among the most bashful of His
Majesty’s troops in time of peace—when suddenly the
door of the cottage opened and an old woman appeared
on the threshold, armed with a blunderbuss. Glaring
fiercely and shouting, she put the weapon to her hip
and fired. There was a loud bang, and one or two of
the men uttered ejaculations of pain.</p>

<p>“God save us!” Sergeant Mackay cried. “The gude
wife takes us for Germans.” Then addressing the
woman, who was pouring another handful of shot into
the muzzle of her infernal piece of antiquity, he called
out, “Are ye daft or glaikit? Dinna ken that we are
Scots. Anglais.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the only word of French the Highlander knew,
and, on shouting it three times in rapid succession, and
with increased emphasis, it had effect. The old woman
lowered her weapon, and shading her eyes with a lean,
brown, and knotted hand, exclaimed. “Ah, moi dieu,
les Anglais! On me dit que les Anglais sont les amis des
Belgiques. Et je vous aurai tué! Pardonnez-moi
messieurs.”</p>

<p>This speech was of course lost upon the Highlanders,
who would have laughed—so comic was the picture of
this old woman with the ancient gun—had they not
been faint from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Now, as she beckoned to them to approach, they
doffed their caps and filed in at her gate, Sergeant
Mackay leading the way.</p>

<p>The interior of the house was as they had expected—scrupulously
neat and clean.</p>

<p>“Wipe your boots, boys,” Sergeant Mackay whispered.
“We mustn’t put the old lady out more than we can help.”</p>

<p>They all trooped in. As soon as they were seated the
old woman vanished through a low doorway, reappearing
a few seconds later laden with bread and cheese and wine,
which she watched them eat and drink with perfect satisfaction,
and when they had finished, conducted them to
a loft at the back of the cottage, where she made them
understand by signs they could lie as long as they pleased.</p>

<p>“I kinna think,” Sergeant Mackay said, as soon as
their hostess had retired, “where the Germans are. It’s
passing strange they have not put in an appearance here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ve gone by and missed this spot. It’s
nae sae handy,” Private Findlay said. “Anyhow, I’m
for sleeping—for it’s ten days since I shut my eyes.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same with me,” ejaculated Private McCallum.
“I hae not slept a wink since we left Plymouth.”</p>

<p>Apparently they were all of the same opinion—namely,
that they needed rest; and, without further
ado, every man selected a place in the hay, stretched
himself out at full length, and was soon fast asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
The afternoon wore away, the sun set, and one by one
the stars made their appearance, but still the men slept.</p>

<p>The gloom of the forest thickened, and with the long
and waving shadows of the elms and beeches crept
forth forms of a more tangible and sinister nature.
Sergeant Mackay awoke with a start, and, springing to
his feet, strained his ears and listened.</p>

<p>“Nightmare!” he said. “I made certain the
Germans had got hold of me. Weel, weel, it’s nowt but
a dream. I will go and see what the gude wife is about,
and, perhaps, if she hae not gone to bed, she will gie
us some hot tea or milk—that red wine of hers hae
made me uncommon thirsty.” He scrambled down
on to the ground, and, leaving the rest of the men
still asleep, crossed the yard and pushed open the
door leading to the kitchen. He was about to
enter, when there came a half-choking cry and the
front of the house filled with soldiers. Sergeant Mackay
knew them at once—they were Germans! Shrinking
back into the shadow of the doorway he stood and
listened. Though he could not understand their jargon,
he soon formed an idea of what was taking place. They
had caught the old woman by surprise and were discussing
what they should do with her. Had the O——s
been armed, Sergeant Mackay would not have hesitated—he
would have staked anything on a win against
odds at six to one, but in their hasty flight the men had
left their rifles behind them, and it would be sheer
suicide for them to attack the Germans with their bare
fists. Therefore it at once entered his mind to slip out
quietly and warn his comrades, so that they could
escape without their presence being detected. A cry
of pain, however, made him hesitate.</p>

<p>Two Germans had hold of the old woman’s arms and
were twisting them round.</p>

<p>The difficulty of his position was not lost on Sergeant
Mackay. If he played the knight errant and helped the
old woman, he would not be able to give his comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the necessary warning, and they would all be taken
prisoners—perhaps shot. On the other hand this gude
wife had been extremely kind to them, and was proving
her loyalty by maintaining an absolute silence as to
their presence in the cottage. Could he stand by and
see her abused? He could not. There was too much
of the Gael in him for that, and as the old woman gave
another gurgle, he stepped out from his hiding place,
and picking up a kitchen chair, rushed at her captors,
both of whom he stunned. He was, of course, eventually
borne down by numbers, and dragged to the ground.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with him?” one of the men who
were holding him asked. “The dog! He has broken
Fritz’s head, and more than half killed Hans. He has
arms like a bullock.”</p>

<p>“Hang him,” the sergeant in charge of the men
replied. “Tie him and the old woman together and
hang them from this beam.” And he pointed to a
great, white rafter running across the ceiling.</p>

<p>Sergeant Mackay’s uniform should, of course, have
protected him, but, then, as the German sergeant put
it, this cottage was well hidden in the woods, the English
were evacuating the country, and no one was likely to
come across the bodies, saving Belgian peasants who
dare not say anything, and German soldiers who would
not say anything. So Sergeant Mackay was dragged
up from the floor, beaten and bruised till there was very
little of him left, bound tightly to the old gude wife, and
hanged with her. The Germans then ransacked the
house, and were preparing to explore the outer premises,
when a bugle rang out, and they hurriedly left the
cottage. Ten minutes later, when all was quiet, into
the house, on tip-toe, stole the rest of the O——s.</p>

<p>“God save us!” ejaculated Private Findlay, starting
back and pointing to the grim figures swaying gently
from the ceiling. “God save us! Sae what the deils
hae done!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Halt!” The word of the Colonel, transmitted by
his adjutant to the head of the column, brought the
O——s to a dead stop.</p>

<p>For this they were not altogether sorry, as they had
been footing it for eight or nine hours on end—and
every little respite was welcome. But the Colonel in
this instance, at least, was not intentionally a good
Samaritan. He had halted, not for the purpose of resting
his men, but because he was fogged as to his whereabouts.
The night was inky black, the country difficult—all
hills, deep depressions and thick woods—and the
Colonel, relying implicitly on the guidance of his intelligence
officer, whom he supposed had made himself
thoroughly familiar with the locality, found himself
obviously going astray. He should now be at a railway
bridge, which was six miles from the village of Etigny,
the last landmark. But no such bridge, as far as he
could judge, was anywhere near, and Lambert, the
intelligence officer, on being questioned, admitted he
did not exactly know where they were. That is why
the Colonel had halted. His object was to make a flank
attack on the German outposts, who were supposed to
be in hiding in a wood, some three miles to the south
of T——, where the extreme right of their main army
lay, and obviously it was of no use advancing any
further until he had ascertained the direction in which
he must steer.</p>

<p>In this wood was a cottage, that had been enlarged
and fortified, and hitherto used as a place of internment
and hospital for English prisoners, until they could be
transported to Potsdam. Reports had reached the
English C.O. that the Germans intended killing all
their prisoners, if compelled to evacuate T——, and so
the O——s were to endeavour to rescue these prisoners,
whilst at the same time outflanking and cutting off the
German outposts. The movement had, of course, to
be in the nature of an entire surprise, and the hospital
to be rushed, if possible, without any firing. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to Lambert, the wood was about one mile due east of
the railway bridge, and there was a tiny path near a
mill, on the outskirts of it, that led to the rear of the
cottage. To miss this path would be dangerous, as the
wood elsewhere was covered with morass and full of
quarries.</p>

<p>“Well, Lambert,” the Colonel said, “you have led
us into a deuced rotten hole, and you must get us out
of it somehow. Surely you have some idea of our
whereabouts.”</p>

<p>Lambert peered again into the darkness and shook
his head. “On a night like this,” he argued, “it is
easy to make mistakes. We must have come much
further to the west than I intended.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, we had better veer round and make for
the extreme east,” the Colonel said tartly.</p>

<p>“Would it not be as well to return to Etigny, sir,”
the Adjutant suggested.</p>

<p>“What, six miles—lose all that time—and with our
men already pretty well exhausted!” the Colonel
retorted angrily. “No, that is utterly out of the question.
Lambert has brought us here, and, egad, he must
take us on to our destination.”</p>

<p>Lambert took a few paces into the darkness, and was
again peering round, when a young lieutenant approached
the Colonel and saluted.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” he said, “a man has just arrived
who says he will act as our guide.”</p>

<p>“A man! A German, I suppose you mean? What
language does he speak?”</p>

<p>“English. At least in part. He is a Scot. Shall I
bring him to you?”</p>

<p>The Colonel gave a gruff assent, and in a few minutes
the subaltern returned, followed by a tall figure enveloped
in a long black cloak. With one accord the Colonel, the
Adjutant and Lambert all swung round and eyed him
curiously.</p>

<p>“Who and what are you?” demanded the Colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m an inhabitant of these parts,” the stranger
answered, “and I have come to offer you my services
as guide.”</p>

<p>“You’re in the pay of the Germans, of course,” the
Colonel retorted sharply. “How did you know we
wanted a guide?”</p>

<p>“I overheard your conversation.”</p>

<p>“What!” the Colonel cried furiously. “You have
been listening to what we were saying. Take him away,
Anderson, and have him shot at once.”</p>

<p>No one moved. A sort of spell stole over Lambert,
the Adjutant, and Anderson, and held them rooted to
the ground. The Colonel repeated his order, and was
about to lay hands on the stranger himself, when the
latter waved him back.</p>

<p>“In an emergency like this, Colonel R——,” he said,
“you must take what Providence sends you. I am no
more a German spy than is your son, Alec, who is,
probably, at the present moment returning from an
afternoon’s march out with the O.T.C. at Cheltenham.”</p>

<p>“Great Heavens,” the Colonel gasped, “how do you
know I have a son Alec, and that he is at Cheltenham.
Who are you, sir? A renegade?”</p>

<p>“No, Colonel, I’m not,” came the reply. “I’m someone
in whom you can place perfect confidence. Trust
yourself to me and I will conduct you at once to the
cottage in the wood.”</p>

<p>“It’s very extraordinary. I don’t for the life of me
know what to make of it,” the Colonel muttered, turning
to the group of officers by his side. “What do you
advise, Lambert?”</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances, sir,” Lambert replied
slowly, “I should trust him. You can have him shot
if he leads us wrong.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” the Colonel murmured, and turning to
the stranger, “Did you hear what Major Lambert
said? I can have you shot, if you lead us astray. And,
by Jove, I will. Take your position at the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
column. If we are successful, I will see that you are
adequately rewarded; if you betray us—you die. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“I do, Colonel,” the stranger replied, “and I accept
your conditions willingly.”</p>

<p>He stepped back, and, at a signal from the Colonel,
followed Lieutenant Anderson to the head of the column.
A sergeant and a corporal—two old and tried veterans—took
up their positions a pace or two behind him, and,
at a word from the Colonel, the whole battalion was
once more on the move. On and on they went. A dull
tramp, tramp, tramp, but in a completely different
direction from the one in which they had previously
been going. It was all so pitch dark that the corporal
and the sergeant had to keep very close to the stranger
to see him.</p>

<p>“He marches just like one of us,” the Sergeant
whispered, “and yet I kenna hear the sound of his
feet. What do you make of him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the Corporal replied. “I seem to
know him, and yet I haven’t seen a feature of his face.
Something about him reminds me of the night I escaped
from N——. It strikes me, Sergeant, that the cottage
the Colonel is after is the very one in which we took
shelter.”</p>

<p>“Then you know the way?”</p>

<p>“Nae,” Corporal Findlay replied. “I was too rushed
and scared that night to remember much. The only
thing I can remember seeing plainly is those two corpses
swinging from the beam—Sergeant Mackay’s and the
gude wife’s—and the scene comes back to me vividly
now as I look at this guide of ours. Why, I dinna ken.”</p>

<p>“Be ready to shoot him, mon, the instant there’s
treachery,” the Sergeant whispered.</p>

<p>“Aye, Aye!” Corporal Findlay replied, tapping the
barrel of his rifle knowingly. “He’ll nae want a second
dose.”</p>

<p>On and on they tramped, till presently they forsook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the highway for a field, and then, plunging down and
down, eventually found themselves upon level ground
facing some trees. “This is the wood,” the guide
observed, “and here is the path. After we have travelled
along it in Indian file, and on tiptoe, for two miles, we
shall emerge into a small clearing, where a low mud wall,
overtopped by a machine gun, will confront us. The
soldiers supposed to be on duty there have been drinking
red wine all day, and are now sleeping. If you approach
noiselessly you will be able to climb the wall and take
them by surprise. The cottage is then yours.”</p>

<p>“But there are sentries in the wood.”</p>

<p>“One! He will be leaning on his rifle dozing. You
must creep up to him and settle him before he has time
to make a sound. I will tell you when we approach
him.”</p>

<p>The guide advanced, and the whole battalion of
O——s stalked along behind him.</p>

<p>“I shall be gay glad when this job is over,” Corporal
Findlay murmured. “I would as soon spend the night
in a kirkyard.”</p>

<p>However, although every now and then a rustling of
leaves that heralded a rabbit made them start, and the
ominous screech of an owl caused the hair on the scalp
of more than one superstitious Celt to bristle, so far
there was no real cause for alarm, and on and on the
battalion stole. At last their guide halted, and every
man behind him instantly followed suit. He whispered
to Corporal Findlay and the Sergeant, and, making way
to let them pass, kept close to their heels, guiding them
by what appeared to be a minute bull’s-eye lantern.</p>

<p>On turning a sharp bend in the path, Corporal Findlay
and the Sergeant saw the sentry, as their guide had
described him, asleep, and, before he had time to awake,
Corporal Findlay had dashed him to the ground with a
swinging blow from the butt-end of his rifle. Three
minutes later, and the head of the column found itself
facing the mud wall and the machine-gun. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the critical moment. If their guide meant mischief, now
was his opportunity. Following closely at his heels,
their rifle and revolver at his head, the Sergeant and
Corporal crept up to the wall, and, one by one, the rest
of the O——s filed into the open space after them.
Holding their breath the Highlanders laid hold of the
top of the wall, then with a sudden stoop, they swung
themselves upwards. The sleeping sentinels awoke, but
only to feel one short, sharp thrust—and the pangs of
death. The outer position won, the Highlanders next
turned their attention to the cottage and the enclosed
space in front of it. There, a strong body of German
infantry were stationed, and, as they came rushing out
to meet the intruders, they shared the same fate as their
companions. In ten minutes there was not a German
left alive, and the O——s, their bayonets dripping with
blood, were busy liberating the English prisoners.
When it was all over, and the Colonel and his staff were
sitting down in the front parlour of the cottage enjoying
some refreshment, Colonel R—— suddenly remembered
the guide. “Anderson,” he said, “fetch that fellow—our
guide—in here. It’s not very gracious behaviour
on our part to leave him outside, for, egad, if it had
not been for him we should not be where we are. Moreover,
I want to see him—I’ve an idea he’s someone I
know.”</p>

<p>The subaltern departed, and after an interval of some
minutes returned, followed only by Corporal Findlay.</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” exclaimed the Colonel, looking up sharply
from his meal. “This is not the man I wanted. Where
is he?”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” the subaltern said, in a voice full
of suppressed excitement, “Corporal Findlay can tell
you all about it—he was the last to see him.”</p>

<p>“The last to see him,” growled the Colonel. “Why,
what the deuce do you mean. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, sir,” Corporal Findlay began. “After
the fight was over I followed him into this cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
right into this room. And he halted just where you are
sitting, under that beam,” and he pointed to the great,
white rafter immediately over the Colonel’s head. “He
then turned round, sir, and drawing aside the cloak,
that had hitherto hidden his face, showed himself to
me!”</p>

<p>“Good God, man, you needn’t look so frightened!”
the Colonel cried. “He wasn’t the devil, was he?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he wasn’t the devil,” Corporal Findlay
responded. “He was Sergeant Mackay of the first
battalion—and the last time I had set eyes on him was
in this room on the night of the retreat from N——, when
I and several others of the O——s found him hanging
from that rafter—dead.”</p>

<p>“And then,” said the Colonel, after a long pause,
“and then what happened?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” Corporal Findlay replied, “he smiled, as
if something had pleased him mightily, and waving his
hand—disappeared.”</p>

<p>“And you expect me to believe such a cock and bull
story as that,” the Colonel said slowly.</p>

<p>“It’s the truth, sir,” Corporal Findlay said slowly.
“Sergeant Scott can corroborate it, for he was with
me all the time.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need to do that,” the Colonel answered,
“for I know you have spoken the truth. This is by no
means my first experience with ghosts—only—for
goodness sake do you and Sergeant Scott say nothing
about it to the other men. If you do there won’t be
an ounce of nerves left among them by the morning.
Germans are one thing, but ghosts another! It was a
splendid revenge for Sergeant Mackay!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="subt">A CASE FROM JAPAN</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Since</span> Japan is a country in which I believe many
people are intensely interested, I do not think I need
apologise for introducing here the following account of
a Japanese haunting.</p>

<p>Never having been to Japan, I cannot lay claim to
having had any ghostly adventures there myself; but
as this is copied, word for word, from the MSS. of
Mr. G. Salis, which was very kindly lent me for the
purpose by Mrs. Salis (Mr. Salis’s mother), I can most
certainly answer for its authenticity.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span><span class="sp2">.</span></p>

<p>“In the spring of 1913, I settled in the village of
Akaji, in the southern Island of Japan, in order to work
a colliery. The country in this part is mountainous and
quite off the track of any tourists, and the inhabitants
remain in a very primitive condition. All the people
are either farmers, miners, or the keepers of very small
shops, and there is not a single hotel nor even an inn.
I stayed at first in one of the rooms of a farm house,
and, after a little while, was able to lease an old thatched
farm house, standing in a small orange orchard, quite
close to the colliery.</p>

<p>“Its owner lived in a little house at the back. My
house was one-storied, but very high, the pitch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
thick thatch being very steep. On entering, one found
a kitchen with various cooking places, but no chimneys:
the smoke curling and losing itself among the huge
rafters that supported the roof. The rest of the house
was raised, and consisted of four rooms divided from
each other by sliding paper-covered screens or fusuma,
and with thick padded straw mats or tatami on the
floor. I got a table and chair, and put up some book
shelves, and made the best room as habitable as possible.
This room had a tokonoma, or recess, painted a dark
grey; and a scroll, a crystal and a vase of flowers put
in it gave the necessary decoration to the severely bare
interior. For the first few months I slept in one of the
back rooms, but later, when it got very hot, I only used
the one room. I had one servant, and as we got up at
dawn, we also went to sleep very early, and usually by
nine o’clock the house was in darkness and silence.
One night I was awakened, and heard talking and
laughing in the next room, only separated from me by
a thin screen. Someone was telling a story in an animated
voice, and his auditor every now and then
ejaculated ‘naruhode’ (to be sure) and ‘sodesuka’ (is
that so), but the voices were kept low and the laughs were
subdued. Just then the kitchen clock struck two. I was
annoyed at my servant having friends in at that hour,
and in the room next mine, and determining to have it
out with him in the morning, I fell asleep. Next morning
he absolutely denied that anyone had been in the house,
and became very indignant when I insisted on what I
had heard.</p>

<p>“Two nights later, I again heard a conversation
going on, and reluctantly got out of bed and from under
the mosquito curtains to investigate. A low chuckling
laugh and then a snatch of song—and I pushed back the
sliding fusuma. The room was in darkness, but I had
a little electric torch which I used in the colliery, and,
pressing its button, the room was brightly lit. Inside
the mosquito curtain, Tanaka lay soundly sleeping—no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
one else was in the room; indeed, but for the futon or
mattress covered by the net it was completely bare,
and the talking still went on, seeming now to come from
the room behind me. I awoke Tanaka, and we went
out into the garden. No one was stirring, and the sounds
came from inside the house. Away, down the road,
three miners were returning from a night shift, and my
servant wanted to run and fetch them, but I did not
see the object of doing so. The mosquitoes were very
bad, and I wanted to get back under the nets, conversations
or no conversations, and so we re-entered the
house. Silence reigned, and I went back to bed—but
not to sleep—for the remainder of that night. Tanaka
took the opportunity, while I was at the colliery the
next morning, to pack up his few belongings and decamp,
leaving a letter saying he could not stay in a house
frequented by demons. I got a girl in from the village
as a makeshift, and afterwards another servant, but
no one would stay in the house after nightfall. I moved
my bed into a room at the back, but still used the other
room as a living room, and soon became used to the fact
that it was haunted. Often, during the day, there were
noises coming from near the tokonoma or recess—as
though someone was cracking his finger joints, a habit
the Japanese have; on several occasions, flowers put
in the vase below the hanging scroll were taken out of
their vase and arranged lying on a tray. One afternoon
I brought my bed into the room, as the autumn was
now getting cold, and I had been unwell for some days
and wanted the benefit of the afternoon sun. I sent
the servant to buy some stamps at the Post Office, a
mile away, and stepped into the garden to gather some
late dahlias. Looking up I distinctly saw a movement
in the room I had left, through the pane of glass let into
the paper-covered shoji. Dropping my flowers, I
pressed my face against the pane, and saw the bedclothes,
which the servant and myself had arranged,
only five minutes previously, had been whisked off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
were lying on the floor. Twice after this, coats hung on
a peg near the tokonoma were found almost immediately
lying on the floor at some distance, one having
been pulled from its peg with such force as partly to
tear it.</p>

<p>“On many nights, when I woke up, I heard talking
in the next room, and gradually came to distinguish a
man’s voice, sometimes I thought two men’s, and
certainly that of a woman and a baby. All the village
were now talking of the haunted house, and, now and
then, neighbours came in to listen to the mysterious
sounds that came, from time to time, from the tokonoma,
but they took good care to be gone before sunset.</p>

<p>“Winter had now come, and I fell ill, and as the
only really pleasant room in the house was made impossible
during the long sleepless nights, I redoubled
my endeavour to find another house. A baby’s wailings
were very distinct, then it was hushed by its mother,
and then long conversations ensued between her and
one or two men—sometimes there were little taps, as
though a tobacco pipe were being emptied of its ashes,
but more often a curious noise was heard which sounded
like ‘putter putter.’ About this time, an account
appeared in all the Japanese newspapers of a bridge in
Tokejo, which was haunted by a woman, and how this
spirit had been laid by priestly intervention, and it was
suggested that the same might be tried in the present
case. I thought it rather a good plan, but, seeing that
it was rather expensive, said that the landlord and not
his foreign tenant should defray the cost and arrange
the matter. But my landlord, who was very unpopular
in the village, and with whom I was not on very good
terms, would do nothing; and as, just then, another
house near the colliery became vacant, I was able to
move, and so at last be free of my ghostly visitants.
Everyone knew of the reason for my leaving, and the
landlord felt sure he would never find another tenant.
After the house had been empty for some time, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
landlord himself determined to live in it for some months,
in order to demonstrate that things were not so bad
after all. He, and his wife, and their two grandchildren
accordingly moved their things across from their other
house, but did not at first occupy the room with the
tokonoma. Seeing, however, that their object in being
in the house at all would be defeated unless this room
was used, they hung some pictures in the recess, placed
a bronze flower vase on a carved stand below them,
and also moved in a gilt shrine containing an image of
Buddha. A few friends were asked in, but all left at
sunset. Next morning I heard that there had been
considerable disturbance at the house, and that the
younger grandson had been taken with convulsions.</p>

<p>“The same day a move was made again to their
former abode, the house was closed, and still remains
empty. A temple on a hill near by was being repaired,
and, on the completion of the work, a priest came to
hold a service. The head man of the village took the
opportunity of consulting with him, and together they
went to see my late landlord. The facts brought to
light, many of which were vaguely known in the district,
are as follows:—The house had been built about one
hundred and fifty years previously by the head of the
family, which was then of more consequence than at
present, although it still owned considerable property in
pine forests and rice fields. A younger brother of the
original builder had conspired against his feudal lord
and had committed suicide—hara-kiri. It was not
known in which room, but probably it was in the
principal one. The next tragedy, that was known of,
had happened some fifteen years before, when the son-in-law,
the father of the two boys already mentioned,
was found hanging from a hook near the wooden ceiling
of the room with the tokonoma. He had been away
for some time in Tokejo, had spent a great deal of
money, and, on his return, had quarrelled violently with
his wife. She had run out of the house with her children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and had stayed on the hillside all night. Next morning
her husband was found as above stated. Some months
later, again in the same room, on the eve of the birth
of her posthumous child, this woman killed herself by
drinking poison, made from the leaves of a shrub still
growing in the garden. During the convulsions which
preceded her death, the child was born, but dead.</p>

<p>“The priest said there was no doubt that the spirits
of these various people, related by family ties, and lives,
passed among the same surroundings, and who had all
come to a dreadful violent end in the same house, and,
probably, the same room, were earthbound, and were in
the habit of assembling and conversing in the room
where their lives had come to an end. Each addition
would strengthen and intensify their bondage, and the
priest expressed his surprise that the spirits were not
actually visible. There was a good deal of discussion
as to the terms for a service and ceremony to free the
house from these ghostly tenants and to give them rest,
I offered a small sum, but as they were, after all, the
relations of the landlord, it was upon him that the bulk
of the expense fell, and he refused to provide the
necessary funds. His argument was that, even were
the spirits ‘laid,’ no one now would rent the house, and
so he would not spend any money on it. Whether he
also thought that the spirits were as happy holding
their ghost-parties round the tokonoma as they would
be if they were at rest, he did not say, as such thoughts
would be contrary to all Japanese ideas on the subject.
Anyway, the house is now closed, the heavy wooden
shutters are rolled across the verandahs and bolted,
the garden is overgrown and choked with weeds, and
the only time when there is human activity about it, is
when the orange trees, burdened with fruit, yield their
golden harvest.</p>

<p>To revert again to my own experiences. I am often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sorry, extremely sorry, I was ever brought into contact
with the Unknown. As I said in one of the early chapters
of this book, I did not go out of my way to seek the
superphysical—it came to me. And it has never given
me any peace. I feel its presence beside me at all times.
In the evening, when I am writing, the curtains that
are tightly drawn across the closed windows slowly
bulge, the candlestick on the mantel-shelf rattles, a
picture on the wall swings out suddenly at me, and,
when I go to bed and try to sleep, I frequently hear
breathings and far-away whispers. Some of these
“presences” no doubt have been with me always—most
probably they were with my ancestors—whilst
others have attached themselves to me in my nocturnal
ramblings.</p>

<p>My wife, who was a confirmed disbeliever before our
marriage, has long since thrown aside her scepticism,
and for a good reason. She has had many startling
proofs of the power the spirit has of making itself
manifest. The night a near relative of mine died both
she and I heard a loud crash on the panel of our bedroom
door, and I, though I only, saw a hooded figure
standing there. Also, besides having heard the banshee,
my wife has seen objects moved by superphysical
agency, seen them fanned by a wind that is apparently
non-existing, had small stones and other articles thrown
at her, and heard all sorts of queer, unaccountable
sounds—laughs, sighs, and moans.</p>

<p>Three ghostly incidents have happened to me within
the past twelve months. The first was in Red Lion
Square. It was twilight; I was alone on the top floor
of the house, and no one else was in the building, saving
the daughter of the caretaker, who was in the basement.
Suddenly footsteps, slow, ponderous footsteps, began
to ascend the stairs—which, being uncarpetted and of
oak, carried the sound—from the hall. Wondering who
it could be, I called out. There was no reply, and the
steps drew nearer. On the landing immediately beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
me they halted. I went out and looked down. No one
was to be seen, and the steps immediately began to
descend. I followed them right down—a few stairs
behind—till they reached the hall, when they abruptly
ceased. I learned afterwards that these footsteps were
quite a common phenomenon in the house, which had
long been haunted by them.</p>

<p>My second experience occurred in the Moscow Road,
Bayswater. Feeling a heavy weight on my bed one
night and wishing to remove it, I put out my hand. It
was immediately seized and held in a warm grip. I sat
up in bed, but could see no one. The hand that clasped
mine was very soft and small—unmistakably that of a
woman. I felt the wrist and forearm, but beyond the
elbow there was nothing.</p>

<p>I was rather alarmed at this occurrence at the time,
as I have a friend who died shortly after experiencing
a similar phenomenon. In my case, however, the
lady, whose hand I immediately identified as the hand
that had clasped mine, and this lady solemnly declared
that upon the same night—we compared dates—she had
dreamed of a hand which was the exact counterpart of
mine, and that, upon shaking hands with me that
afternoon, she had been instantly reminded of her
dream.</p>

<p>That there was nothing in common between us, her
tastes and outlook on life being absolutely at variance
with mine, makes the occurrence, in my opinion, none
the less interesting, though somewhat difficult to account
for.</p>

<p>My last experience occurred only a few days ago, as I
was sitting on the stairs of a haunted house near Ealing.
I had applied to the landlord for permission to spend
the night there, and, pending his reply, had obtained
the keys from the agent, in order to see what the house
was like by daylight. Having just finished jotting down
some notes—a memorandum of something I had suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thought of—I paused, still holding the pencil in my
hand, whilst my note-book lay open on my knee. I
had not sat thus for more than a minute, when, with a
thrill of surprise, I felt the pencil suddenly taken from
my hand, and, looking down, I distinctly saw it, of its
own accord, scrawl right across my book. Whether
what I afterwards found written in my note-book was
written by the spirit that haunted the house, or by a
projection of one of my own personalities, I cannot
say; neither can I, myself, nor anyone to whom I have
shown the symbolic writing, tell what it means. The
appended is a facsimile.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/writing.png" width="436" height="49" alt="Facsimile" title="Facsimile" />
</div>

<p>I might add that this is my one and only experience
of spirit-writing, and also that it was my one and only
experience in the haunted house near Ealing, as I did
not succeed in getting leave to spend a night there.</p>

<p>Although I must confess I have made little progress
so far in my investigations, for my failure to decipher
spirit-writing is not the only set-back that I have
encountered, I still have hopes. I hope that some
day, when I am brought face to face with the Unknown,
in a haunted house or elsewhere, I may be able to hit
upon some mode of communication with it, and discover
something that may be of real service both to myself
and to the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>If only I could overcome fear!</p>

<p>It is March 28th, midnight, and as I pen these concluding
words, my mind reverts to the symbols and the
date—March 28th, twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>Suddenly I hear footsteps—distant footsteps on the
road outside—coming in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>I glance at my wife, wondering whether she hears
them too. She is asleep, however, and, as I covertly
watch her, I see a look of terror gradually steal into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
face. Clicking steps. They come nearer and nearer.
They stop for a moment at our door, and then—thank
God—pass slowly on.</p>

<p>I look out of the window—the road is absolutely
deserted, but from close at hand the sounds are wafted
to me—click, click, click, fainter, fainter, fainter—until
they abruptly cease.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
